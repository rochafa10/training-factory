## Design Notes
- Keep slides visual and framework-heavy — this audience wants actionable tools, not theory
- Use comparison slides (good vs. bad answers) liberally
- Include real examples relevant to operations/distribution center leadership
- Minimize text per slide — frameworks should be visual, not paragraph-heavy
- Include a "cheat sheet" summary slide they can screenshot and keep
