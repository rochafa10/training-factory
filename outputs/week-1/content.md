## Section 1: Why AI Matters for Operations

**Duration:** 10 minutes (0:00 - 0:10)
**Activity:** Lecture + Discussion
**Objective:** Understand the business case for AI in DC operations and set realistic expectations

---

### Key Concept

AI tools are software programs that can read, write, analyze, and summarize text. They work by predicting what words should come next based on patterns learned from massive amounts of text. They do not think or understand like humans do. They are very fast at processing information, but they make mistakes -- sometimes confidently.

> **From Research:** "AI tools like large language models (LLMs) are systems that predict likely text continuations based on training patterns. They excel at processing large volumes of data, identifying patterns, and generating human-like text, but do not 'think' or 'understand' like humans."
> **Source:** research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 1

For you as an AGM, AI is a power tool. It does not replace your judgment. It handles the repetitive, time-consuming parts of your work so you can focus on leading your team, solving problems, and making decisions.

> **From Research:** "AI is most effective when positioned as a collaborative tool that handles high-volume, repetitive analytical work while humans focus on strategic decision-making, exception handling, and areas requiring contextual judgment."
> **Source:** research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 1

---

### Why This Matters

Think about your average day. You write emails. You prep for standups. You review KPIs. You draft vendor communications. You fill out safety reports. You build schedules. Most of these tasks follow a pattern. AI is excellent at pattern-based work.

Here is what AI can help you do right now:
- **Draft your standup talking points** in 2 minutes instead of 15
- **Write a professional vendor email** in 1 minute instead of 10
- **Summarize a safety incident** from raw notes in 30 seconds
- **Analyze headcount allocation** across shifts instantly
- **Create training outlines** for new associates in 3 minutes

The numbers back this up. Organizations that train their teams on AI tools see real results.

> **From Research:** "Organizations achieving 20-30% efficiency improvements when implementing proper AI training." Workers using AI tools save an average of 7.5 hours per week.
> **Source:** research.md, Executive Summary; Key Statistics (Centric Consulting, Worklytics 2025)

But here is the reality check: 95% of AI pilots fail before they reach production. The failures are almost never about the technology. They fail because people do not get proper training, expectations are wrong, or policies are unclear.

> **From Research:** "95% of AI pilots fail due to organizational factors rather than technology."
> **Source:** research.md, Key Statistics (MIT Generative AI Study, Fortune)

That is exactly why you are here. This course gives you the training, the right expectations, and complete policy clarity. By the end of today, you will have used AI for real work tasks. By the end of this course, you will save 40-60 minutes every day.

---

### What AI Can and Cannot Do

**AI is good at:**
- Analyzing and summarizing large documents quickly
- Generating draft communications and reports
- Identifying patterns in data
- Answering questions about processes and procedures
- Creating structured outputs from unstructured inputs

**AI is NOT good at:**
- Making decisions that require your judgment and experience
- Performing reliable math (always double-check calculations)
- Knowing what happened at your DC yesterday (unless you tell it)
- Replacing the human relationships you have with your team
- Guaranteeing accuracy (it can and will make confident mistakes)

> **From Research:** AI key limitations include: "Cannot reliably explain its own reasoning," "Frequently makes overconfident predictions about incorrect information," "Struggles with novel situations outside training data," "Cannot perform reliable arithmetic or formal logic," and "May 'hallucinate' false information presented confidently."
> **Source:** research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 1

---

### The Right Mindset

Think of AI like a very fast, very eager new hire who has read a lot of books but has never worked in your DC. They can draft things quickly, but you always need to review their work. Over time, you learn what they are good at and where they need supervision. That is exactly how AI works.

**Tesla Values Connection:**
- **Ownership:** You own every output. AI assists, you decide.
- **Curiosity:** Explore what these tools can do. Push boundaries.

---

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Thinking AI will replace your job
- Why it happens: Media hype creates fear
- How to avoid: AI augments your work. It handles the repetitive parts. Your judgment, leadership, and experience are irreplaceable.
- **Source:** research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 1

**Mistake 2:** Expecting perfect results on the first try
- Why it happens: People assume AI "understands" their request perfectly
- How to avoid: Think of AI interactions as conversations. Your first ask gets you a draft. You refine from there. Iteration is normal.
- **Source:** research.md, Common Pitfalls

**Mistake 3:** Thinking AI is too complicated for non-technical people
- Why it happens: Tech jargon creates intimidation
- How to avoid: If you can write an email, you can use AI. Bottle Rocket is a chat window. You type what you need. It responds.
- **Source:** research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 3 (Adult Learning Principles)

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 10 minutes (0:00 - 0:10)

SAY: "Good morning, everyone. I want to start with a question. How many
of you have heard someone say AI is going to replace managers? [Pause for
hands.] I get it. That is the story in the news. But here is the truth:
AI is not replacing you. AI is replacing the parts of your day that slow
you down. The emails that take 10 minutes to draft. The standup prep
that takes 15 minutes every morning. The vendor communications you
rewrite three times to get the tone right. By the end of today, you
will do those tasks in a fraction of the time. That is what this
course is about."

ASK: "Before we dive in -- what is one task you do every day that
feels repetitive? Something you wish you could do faster?"
[Let 2-3 AGMs share. Write their answers on a shared screen or
whiteboard. These become reference points throughout the day.]

DEMO: No demo in this section. Verbal and discussion only.

TRANSITION: "Great. Those are exactly the kinds of tasks AI can help
with. But before we touch any AI tool, we need to talk about the
rules. Tesla has a clear policy on which AI tools you can use and
which ones you cannot. Let's go through that now."
```

---

## Section 2: Tesla AI Policy Deep Dive

**Duration:** 20 minutes (0:10 - 0:30)
**Activity:** Lecture + Interactive Quiz
**Objective:** Demonstrate complete mastery of Tesla's three-tier AI policy

---

### Key Concept

Tesla has a clear, three-tier policy for AI tools. Every AI tool falls into one of three categories: Approved, Conditionally Approved, or Prohibited. The single most important rule is this: **if a tool is not listed at go.tesla.com/aitools, it is prohibited.**

This is not optional. Violations can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

> **From Research:** "Tesla Data = any information about Tesla, customers, employees, affiliates, or users."
> **Source:** research.md, Policy Reference Summary

---

### Why This Matters

You manage 30-50 associates. They will come to you with questions about AI tools. "Can I use ChatGPT for this?" "Is it OK to record our standup with AI?" "My kid told me to try Claude for work." You need to know the answers cold. Not "I think so." Not "Let me check." You need instant recall.

This section gives you that. By the end of these 20 minutes, you will be able to answer any AI policy question your team throws at you.

---

### The Three Tiers

#### TIER 1: APPROVED (Tesla Data OK)

These tools are fully approved. You can use real Tesla data with them -- headcount, KPIs, schedules, vendor details, employee names, customer information, internal processes. All of it.

| Tool | URL | What It Does |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **Bottle Rocket** | go.tesla.com/chat | AI chat with 8 models (Qwen 3, Grok 4, GPT OSS, Gemini), personas, file upload, web search |
| **IT Assist** | it.bottlerocket.tesla.com | IT helpdesk AI assistant |
| **Employee Assist** | hr.bottlerocket.tesla.com | HR and employee services AI |
| **Energy Chats** | energy.bottlerocket.tesla.com | Energy division AI assistant |
| **Nabu RAG Agents** | nabu.bottlerocket.tesla.com | Self-service AI agent builder (38 agents and growing) |
| **Nova** | nova.tesla.com | Tesla's AI platform with @-tag integration |
| **M365 Copilot Chat** | m365.cloud.microsoft.chat | Microsoft AI chat (corporate link ONLY) |

**Key point about Bottle Rocket:** It gives you access to 8 powerful AI models including Qwen 3, Grok 4, OpenAI GPT OSS, and Gemini — all running through Tesla's secure platform. You are not getting a watered-down version. You are getting production-grade models, approved for Tesla Data.

> **From Research:** "Bottle Rocket -- Tesla Data: Allowed -- can use with real performance metrics, employee names, internal processes."
> **Source:** research.md, Tool-Specific Insights

---

#### TIER 2: CONDITIONALLY APPROVED (NO Tesla Data)

These tools are approved for use, but you CANNOT put any Tesla data into them. Use them only for generic, non-Tesla work.

| Tool | What It Does | Key Restriction |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | Code assistance in VS Code | NO Tesla data. Generic coding only. |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | Command-line AI assistance | NO Tesla data. |
| **Microsoft Power Automate AI features** | Workflow automation | NO Tesla data. |

We will cover GitHub Copilot in detail during Week 3. For now, just know it exists and that it is conditionally approved with no Tesla data allowed.

---

#### TIER 3: PROHIBITED (Do Not Use)

These tools are banned. Period. Do not use them for any Tesla work, even if they seem similar to approved tools.

| Tool / Activity | Why It Is Prohibited |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| **ChatGPT** (chat.openai.com) | External platform. Data not secure. |
| **Claude.ai** (claude.ai) | External platform. Data not secure. |
| **Gemini** (gemini.google.com) | External web version. Data not secure. |
| **Perplexity** | External AI search. Not approved. |
| **Grok via X/xAI apps** | External platform. Not Tesla-controlled. |
| **Apple Intelligence** on corporate devices | Not approved for corporate use. |
| **AI meeting recording/transcription** | Prohibited regardless of tool. Any tool. |
| **AI during interviews** | Prohibited for both interviewers and candidates. |
| **Ray-Ban Meta / AI wearables in facilities** | No AI-enabled recording devices in Tesla facilities. |
| **DeepSeek** (China-hosted) | Foreign-hosted. Data security risk. |
| **NotebookLM** | Not approved. |
| **Cloud AI builders** (Vercel v0, Lovable, Bolt, Replit) | External cloud platforms. Not approved. |

> **From Research:** "Prohibited tools include ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini (external), Meeting transcription, Apple Intelligence."
> **Source:** research.md, Policy Reference Summary

### The Traps: Policy Scenarios That Trick People

These are the scenarios where well-meaning people make policy mistakes. Learn these cold.

#### Trap 1: The Grok Trap

**Same model. Different platform. Different rules.**

- Grok via **Bottle Rocket** (go.tesla.com/chat) = APPROVED. Tesla data OK.
- Grok via **Nova** (nova.tesla.com) = APPROVED. Tesla data OK.
- Grok via **X** (the social media app) or **xAI website** = PROHIBITED.

Why? It is the same AI model, but the platform matters. Bottle Rocket and Nova route through Tesla's secure infrastructure. X and xAI do not. Think of it like water: the water is the same, but one pipe is clean and the other is not. Use the clean pipe.

**Test yourself:** Your associate says, "I use Grok on my phone through X to help with work stuff. Is that OK?"
**Answer:** No. Grok through X is prohibited. Tell them to use Bottle Rocket at go.tesla.com/chat instead. Same model, approved platform.

---

#### Trap 2: The M365 Copilot URL Trap

**Same tool. Different URL. Different rules.**

- M365 Copilot Chat via **m365.cloud.microsoft.chat** (corporate link) = APPROVED
- M365 Copilot Chat via **copilot.microsoft.com** = NOT APPROVED

The corporate link routes through Tesla's enterprise agreement. The public URL does not. If you are going to use M365 Copilot Chat, make sure you are using the corporate link. Bookmark it.

**Test yourself:** A team member says, "I went to copilot.microsoft.com and used Copilot for my report."
**Answer:** That is the wrong URL. The approved URL is m365.cloud.microsoft.chat. Have them switch immediately.

---

#### Trap 3: The "Tesla Data" Definition

**What counts as Tesla Data?**

Tesla Data is any information that is not publicly available outside Tesla. If a member of the public could not find it on tesla.com or in a news article, it is Tesla Data.

| Tesla Data (DO NOT put in unapproved tools) | NOT Tesla Data (public info, OK anywhere) |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Headcount numbers for your DC | Tesla's stock price |
| Associate names and schedules | Tesla's publicly announced product specs |
| KPIs and performance metrics | General supply chain best practices |
| Vendor names and contract details | Public news about Tesla |
| Customer information | Generic operations frameworks |
| Internal process documents and SOPs | Industry benchmarks from public reports |
| Safety incident details | General safety guidelines from OSHA |
| Shift schedules and labor plans | Your own personal opinion (not about Tesla internals) |
| Financial data and budgets | Publicly released Tesla financial reports |

**Test yourself:** You want AI help writing a vendor email about a delayed shipment from Vendor X. Can you paste the vendor name, contract terms, and shipment details into ChatGPT?
**Answer:** No. Vendor names and contract details are Tesla Data. Use Bottle Rocket instead. Same quality AI, approved platform.

---

#### Trap 4: The Meeting Recording Trap

**AI meeting recording and transcription is prohibited. No exceptions. No tools.**

This one is absolute. It does not matter which tool you use. It does not matter if the tool is otherwise approved. AI meeting recording and transcription is banned.

- Otter.ai for meeting notes? **Prohibited.**
- Teams AI transcription? **Prohibited.**
- A third-party app that "just takes notes"? **Prohibited.**
- Your associate records a standup on their phone with an AI app? **Prohibited.**

**Why?** Meetings contain sensitive information. AI transcription tools process that audio through external servers. Tesla does not allow it.

**Test yourself:** Your team asks, "Can we use Bottle Rocket to transcribe our weekly team meeting?"
**Answer:** No. AI meeting transcription is prohibited regardless of which tool you use. Take notes manually or use non-AI meeting minutes.

---

#### Trap 5: The Interview Trap

**AI use during interviews is prohibited for both sides.**

- Using AI to generate interview questions in real-time during the interview? **Prohibited.**
- Using AI to evaluate candidate responses during the interview? **Prohibited.**
- Candidates using AI to answer your questions? **Also prohibited.**

You CAN use AI to prepare for interviews beforehand (drafting questions in Bottle Rocket before the interview starts). You cannot use it during the live interview.

---

#### Trap 6: The Wearables Trap

**Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and AI wearables are not allowed in Tesla facilities.**

These devices have always-on cameras and microphones that can stream to AI. They are not permitted inside any Tesla facility. If you see someone wearing them, ask them to remove the devices or leave the facility.

---

### The Golden Rule

**When in doubt, check go.tesla.com/aitools.** If a tool is not listed there, it is prohibited. It is that simple.

---

### Policy Quick-Reference Card

Save this. Share it with your team.

```
TESLA AI POLICY -- QUICK REFERENCE
====================================

APPROVED (Tesla Data OK):
  Bottle Rocket      go.tesla.com/chat
  IT Assist           it.bottlerocket.tesla.com
  Employee Assist     hr.bottlerocket.tesla.com
  Energy Chats        energy.bottlerocket.tesla.com
  Nabu RAG Agents     nabu.bottlerocket.tesla.com
  Nova                nova.tesla.com
  M365 Copilot Chat   m365.cloud.microsoft.chat (CORPORATE LINK ONLY)

CONDITIONAL (NO Tesla Data):
  GitHub Copilot          (generic coding only)
  GitHub Copilot CLI      (generic coding only)
  Power Automate AI       (generic workflows only)

PROHIBITED (Do Not Use):
  ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini (web), Perplexity, Grok via X/xAI,
  DeepSeek (China-hosted), Apple Intelligence (corporate devices),
  AI meeting recording, AI in interviews,
  Ray-Ban Meta / AI wearables in facilities,
  DeepSeek, NotebookLM, cloud AI builders (Vercel v0, Lovable,
  Bolt, Replit)

REMEMBER:
  - If it is not at go.tesla.com/aitools, it is PROHIBITED
  - Same model + different platform = different rules
  - AI meeting transcription = ALWAYS prohibited
  - You must attribute AI use transparently
  - You must validate ALL AI output
  - Violations = disciplinary action up to termination
====================================
```

---

### Two More Rules Everyone Must Know

**Rule 1: You must attribute AI use.**
If you used AI to help create something, say so. Be transparent. This is not about shame -- it is about honesty and accountability. Example: "This draft was created with assistance from Bottle Rocket and reviewed by me."

**Rule 2: You must validate all AI output.**
AI can make things up. It can present false information with total confidence. You are responsible for checking the output before you share it, send it, or act on it. We will practice this skill in Section 9 today.

---

### Interactive Policy Quiz

**Instructions for the group:** The instructor reads each scenario aloud. Participants answer: Approved, Conditional, Prohibited, or It Depends. Discuss each answer.

**Scenario 1:** You paste your DC's headcount numbers into Bottle Rocket to analyze shift coverage.
**Answer:** APPROVED. Bottle Rocket is approved for Tesla Data.

**Scenario 2:** You open ChatGPT to draft a quick email about a vendor delay, including the vendor name and shipment details.
**Answer:** PROHIBITED. ChatGPT is a prohibited tool. Vendor names and shipment details are Tesla Data.

**Scenario 3:** Your associate uses Grok on the X app to look up best practices for warehouse safety.
**Answer:** PROHIBITED. Grok via X is prohibited, even for general topics during work. The approved way to use Grok is through Bottle Rocket.

**Scenario 4:** You use M365 Copilot Chat at copilot.microsoft.com to summarize a meeting.
**Answer:** PROHIBITED (wrong URL). The approved URL is m365.cloud.microsoft.chat. Also, if the meeting was AI-recorded/transcribed, that is a separate violation.

**Scenario 5:** You use GitHub Copilot to write a Python script that calculates shipping costs. The script uses generic formulas with no Tesla data.
**Answer:** CONDITIONALLY APPROVED. GitHub Copilot is allowed for generic coding. No Tesla data was used. This is fine.

**Scenario 6:** You use GitHub Copilot and paste in your DC's actual headcount numbers to create a staffing calculator.
**Answer:** PROHIBITED USE. GitHub Copilot is only conditionally approved -- no Tesla Data. Headcount numbers are Tesla Data. Use Bottle Rocket for this instead.

**Scenario 7:** Your team wants to use Otter.ai to transcribe your weekly safety meeting.
**Answer:** PROHIBITED. AI meeting transcription is prohibited regardless of the tool.

**Scenario 8:** You use Bottle Rocket to draft interview questions before an interview, then print them out and use them during the interview without any AI running.
**Answer:** APPROVED. Using AI to prepare before the interview is fine. Using AI during the live interview is what is prohibited.

**Scenario 9:** A visitor arrives at your DC wearing Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.
**Answer:** Not allowed in the facility. AI wearables with cameras/microphones are prohibited in Tesla facilities. Ask them to remove the device.

**Scenario 10:** You are unsure if a new AI tool called "WorkBot" is approved. What do you do?
**Answer:** Check go.tesla.com/aitools. If WorkBot is not listed, it is prohibited. Do not use it.

---

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Using ChatGPT because "it is faster" or "I already have an account"
- Why it happens: ChatGPT is the most well-known AI tool. People default to what they know.
- How to avoid: Bottle Rocket has the same models. Grok 4, Qwen 3 235B, Gemini 3 Pro -- all available at go.tesla.com/chat. Same quality, approved platform.
- **Source:** research.md, Common Pitfalls

**Mistake 2:** Not knowing what counts as "Tesla Data"
- Why it happens: People think only "classified" info counts. They do not realize headcount, schedules, and vendor names qualify.
- How to avoid: If a member of the public could not find the information on tesla.com, it is Tesla Data. When in doubt, use Bottle Rocket.
- **Source:** research.md, Policy Reference Summary

**Mistake 3:** Assuming all Microsoft tools are approved
- Why it happens: Tesla uses Microsoft products, so people assume all Microsoft AI features are OK.
- How to avoid: Only M365 Copilot Chat at the corporate URL (m365.cloud.microsoft.chat) is approved. Other Microsoft AI features like Copilot at copilot.microsoft.com are not.

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 20 minutes (0:10 - 0:30)

SAY: "Now we get to the most important part of today. The policy. I
know policy sections can feel dry, but this one matters. If you take
nothing else from today, take this: know which tools are approved,
which are conditional, and which are banned. Your team will ask you
about this. Let's make sure you have the answers."

ASK: "Quick show of hands -- has anyone on your team already asked
you about using ChatGPT or another AI tool for work? [Likely yes.]
That is exactly why we are covering this in detail."

DEMO: Open go.tesla.com/aitools in a browser tab. Show participants
where to find the official list. This is their single source of
truth.

KEY MOMENTS:
- Spend extra time on the Grok Trap (Trap 1). This is the one that
  trips people up the most. Same model, different platform.
- The M365 URL distinction (Trap 2) is the second most common
  mistake.
- The meeting transcription ban (Trap 4) often surprises people.
  Make sure it lands.
- Run the 10-scenario quiz. Have participants answer aloud or via
  chat. Correct immediately. Do not let wrong answers go uncorrected.
- Hand out or screen-share the Quick-Reference Card at the end.
  Tell them to bookmark go.tesla.com/aitools.

TRANSITION: "Great. You now know the rules cold. The good news? The
tool you are allowed to use is excellent. Let me show you Bottle
Rocket."
```

## Section 3: Introduction to Bottle Rocket

**Duration:** 15 minutes (0:30 - 0:45)
**Activity:** Live Demo
**Objective:** Navigate Bottle Rocket confidently -- access, interface, model selection, first query

---

### Key Concept

Bottle Rocket is Tesla's approved AI chat platform. You access it at **go.tesla.com/chat**. It gives you access to the same powerful AI models available on ChatGPT, Claude.ai, and Gemini -- but through Tesla's secure platform where Tesla Data is allowed.

> **From Research:** "Bottle Rocket -- Access: go.tesla.com/chat. Tesla Data: Allowed -- can use with real performance metrics, employee names, internal processes."
> **Source:** research.md, Tool-Specific Insights

Think of Bottle Rocket as a chat window. You type a question or request. The AI responds. You can follow up, ask for changes, or start a new conversation. It is as simple as texting.

---

### Why This Matters

This is the tool you will use every day after today. It will draft your emails, prep your standups, analyze your KPIs, write your vendor communications, and create training materials. The better you know the interface, the faster you work.

---

### Interface Walkthrough

**Step 1: Access**
- Open your browser
- Go to **go.tesla.com/chat**
- Log in with your Tesla credentials

**Step 2: The Chat Interface (v2.0.5)**
- You will see a text input box at the bottom. This is where you type your prompt.
- Above it is the conversation area where AI responses appear.
- On the left sidebar: conversation history (90-day retention), chat management
- Top bar: model selector dropdown, New Chat / New Private Chat buttons

**Step 2b: Key Features**
- **Model Selector** (top): Choose from 8 AI models — each has different strengths
- **Personas** (sidebar): Pre-built AI personalities that shape how the AI responds
- **File Upload**: Drag & drop PDFs, spreadsheets, or images for AI analysis
- **Web Search Toggle** (globe icon): Turn on to ground AI responses with live internet data
- **New Private Chat**: Chat that is not saved to history — for sensitive conversations

**Step 3: Model Selection**
This is important. Bottle Rocket gives you access to 8 AI models. Each model is built by a different company. Each has different strengths. You select the model before typing your message. The default is Qwen 3 30B — fast and reliable for most tasks.

**Available Models (8 total as of v2.0.5):**
| Model | Provider | Speed | Best For |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Qwen 3 30B** (DEFAULT) | Alibaba (via Bottle Rocket) | Fast | Daily tasks, quick answers, general operations |
| **Qwen 3 235B** | Alibaba (via Bottle Rocket) | Medium | Complex analysis, detailed reasoning |
| **OpenAI GPT OSS 120B** | OpenAI (via Bottle Rocket) | Medium | Writing, general-purpose tasks |
| **Grok 4** | xAI (via Bottle Rocket) | Medium | Deep research, nuanced analysis |
| **Grok 4 Mini** | xAI (via Bottle Rocket) | Fast | Quick reasoning, fast iteration |
| **Grok 4 Mini (High)** | xAI (via Bottle Rocket) | Med-Fast | Balanced Grok quality and speed |
| **Gemini 3 Pro** | Google (via Bottle Rocket) | Medium | Multimodal, image analysis, data work |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | Google (via Bottle Rocket) | Slower | Long document analysis, complex tasks |

For today, start with the default **Qwen 3 30B** -- it is fast and reliable for most operations tasks. Switch models when you need deeper analysis (Grok 4, Qwen 3 235B) or specific strengths (Gemini for data, GPT OSS for writing).

> **From Research:** Model selection tips -- "Grok 4: Complex analysis, nuanced writing. Qwen 3 30B: Balanced tasks, good reasoning. Gemini 2.5 Pro: Quick answers, simple tasks."
> **Source:** research.md, Tool-Specific Insights

**Step 4: Starting a Conversation**
- Select your model
- Type your message in the text box
- Press Enter or click Send
- Wait for the response (usually 5-30 seconds)
- Read the response
- Follow up if needed

**Step 5: Managing Conversations**
- Start a new conversation for new topics (click "New Chat")
- Stay in the same conversation when iterating on the same task
- Your conversation history is saved on the left sidebar

### Live Demo: First Query

**Demo script for the instructor:**

1. Open go.tesla.com/chat on screen share
2. Select Qwen 3 30B as the model
3. Type this prompt:

```
You are an operations manager at a distribution center.

I need to prepare talking points for my morning standup. Yesterday
we processed 2,847 orders with 42 associates on shift. We had a
conveyor belt issue from 2-4 PM that delayed outbound shipments
by about 2 hours. Today we expect a normal volume day.

Create brief standup talking points. Use bullet points. Keep it
under 150 words. Include: yesterday's key metrics, the main issue
and what we did about it, and today's focus areas.
```

4. Show the response
5. Point out how quickly it generated useful content
6. Follow up with: "Make the conveyor issue section more specific. We had maintenance replace the drive belt and the line was back up by 4:15 PM."
7. Show the updated response

**Time comparison:**
- Manual standup prep: 15-20 minutes
- With Bottle Rocket: 2-3 minutes (including review)
- **Savings: 12-17 minutes per day, just on standup prep**

> **From Research:** "Daily Standup Preparation -- Without AI: 15-20 minutes manually reviewing reports, compiling notes, formatting talking points. With AI: Draft talking points in 2 minutes, saving 13-18 minutes."
> **Source:** research.md, Real-World Examples - Example 1

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Not selecting the right model
- Why it happens: People do not realize different models have different strengths
- How to avoid: For most daily tasks, Qwen 3 30B or Grok 4 are great defaults. We will cover model selection in detail in Section 7.
- **Source:** research.md, Tool-Specific Insights

**Mistake 2:** Starting every conversation from scratch when iterating
- Why it happens: People treat each message like a separate request
- How to avoid: Stay in the same conversation when refining. Say "Make it shorter" or "Add a section about safety." The AI remembers what you were working on.
- **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Iterate Rather Than Perfect

**Mistake 3:** Typing one-word or vague requests
- Why it happens: People treat AI like a Google search
- How to avoid: Give context. The more you tell it about your situation, the better the response. We cover this in the next section on prompt engineering.
- **Source:** research.md, Common Pitfalls - Vague prompts

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 15 minutes (0:30 - 0:45)

SAY: "Let me show you the tool you are going to use every single
day after today. This is Bottle Rocket. It is at go.tesla.com/chat.
Bookmark this right now. Everyone -- go ahead and open it in your
browser."

ASK: "Can everyone see the interface? Does anyone have trouble
logging in?" [Pause. Troubleshoot any login issues immediately.
Do not proceed until everyone is in.]

DEMO:
1. Screen share go.tesla.com/chat
2. Walk through the interface: model selector, chat box, history
3. Select Qwen 3 30B
4. Type the standup prep prompt (scripted above) -- type it live,
   do not paste. Let them see you write it.
5. Show the response. Read a few lines aloud.
6. Follow up with the conveyor detail. Show how iteration works.
7. Highlight the time saved: "That took us 2 minutes. Doing this
   by hand takes 15."

TRANSITION: "So you have seen it work. But notice something about
that prompt I wrote -- it had a lot of detail. I told it who I was,
what happened, what I needed, and how I wanted it formatted. That
was not an accident. There is a formula for writing good prompts,
and that is what we cover next."
```

## Section 4: Prompt Engineering Basics

**Duration:** 15 minutes (0:45 - 1:00)
**Activity:** Lecture + Examples
**Objective:** Apply the ROLE + CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT prompt formula

---

### Key Concept

Prompt engineering is the practice of writing clear, structured instructions for AI tools. The quality of your AI output depends directly on the quality of your input. A vague prompt gets a vague answer. A specific, structured prompt gets a useful answer.

We use a simple formula called **ROLE + CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT**. Every prompt you write should include all four parts.

> **From Research:** "A structured approach to writing prompts that dramatically improves AI output quality by explicitly specifying four components in every request. Research shows non-technical users who incorporate all four components obtain outputs rated substantially more helpful, relevant, and actionable than users who simply state their request."
> **Source:** research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 2

---

### Why This Matters

You would not send a new associate to do a task without explaining who they are working with, what the situation is, what exactly you need done, and how you want it delivered. Prompting AI is the same thing. Skip any of the four parts and the output suffers.

---

### The Four-Part Formula

#### ROLE: Tell the AI who it is

This sets the AI's perspective and expertise level. It changes how the AI writes and what knowledge it prioritizes.

| ROLE Example | What It Does |
|-------------|-------------|
| "You are an experienced distribution center operations manager." | Focuses on DC-specific language and priorities |
| "You are a professional email writer." | Focuses on tone, structure, and business communication |
| "You are a safety compliance specialist." | Focuses on OSHA standards, incident reporting, risk language |
| "You are a training instructor for warehouse associates." | Uses simple language, step-by-step instructions |

---

#### CONTEXT: Give the AI the background

This is the information the AI needs to give you a relevant answer. Without context, the AI guesses. With context, the AI tailors its response to your specific situation.

| CONTEXT Example | Why It Matters |
|----------------|---------------|
| "I manage the morning shift at the Tampa DC with 45 associates." | AI knows your team size, location, and shift |
| "We had 3 safety incidents this month, up from 1 last month." | AI understands the trend and urgency |
| "Our vendor XYZ has been late on 4 of the last 6 deliveries." | AI can reference the pattern in its response |
| "I am preparing for a regional leadership meeting tomorrow." | AI adjusts the formality and detail level |

---

#### TASK: Tell the AI exactly what you need

Be specific. Use action verbs. One task per prompt works better than cramming multiple tasks together.

| Vague Task (Weak) | Specific Task (Strong) |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| "Help me with headcount." | "Analyze this shift schedule and identify where we are understaffed by more than 2 people." |
| "Write something about safety." | "Draft a 200-word safety incident summary for the near-miss forklift event on January 15." |
| "I need an email." | "Write a professional email to our vendor requesting an updated delivery timeline for the delayed shipment originally due January 20." |

> **From Research:** "Begin prompts with strong action verbs like 'Generate,' 'Summarize,' 'Analyze,' or 'Create.' Models respond better to direct commands than soft openings like 'Can you...' or 'I need...'"
> **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Use Action-Oriented Language

---

#### FORMAT: Tell the AI how to structure the response

Without format instructions, the AI picks its own structure. That structure might not match what you need.

| FORMAT Example | What You Get |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Use bullet points. Keep it under 200 words." | Concise, scannable summary |
| "Create a table with columns for Name, Shift, and Hours." | Structured data you can paste into a spreadsheet |
| "Write it as a professional email with a subject line." | Ready-to-send email format |
| "Number each step. Include a time estimate for each." | Step-by-step action plan |
| "Use three sections: Summary, Key Issues, Recommended Actions." | Executive report structure |

---

### Good Prompt vs. Bad Prompt -- Side by Side

**BAD PROMPT:**
```
Help me with my standup.
```

**What is wrong:** No role. No context. No specific task. No format. The AI does not know who you are, what happened, what you need, or how you want it.

**GOOD PROMPT:**
```
ROLE: You are an experienced operations manager at a distribution center.

CONTEXT: I manage the morning shift at the Greenville SC distribution
center. We have 38 associates on shift today. Yesterday we processed
2,100 orders, which is 95% of our daily target of 2,200. We had two
associates call out, which put pressure on the pick line.

TASK: Create talking points for my 7 AM standup meeting. Highlight
yesterday's performance, the staffing gap, and today's priorities.

FORMAT:
- Use bullet points
- Keep it under 150 words
- Three sections: Yesterday Recap, Staffing Update, Today's Priorities
```

**What is right:** The AI knows its role (operations manager), has the context (Greenville, 38 associates, 2,100 orders, 2 callouts), knows the task (standup talking points), and knows the format (bullets, 150 words, 3 sections).

---

### The Iteration Principle

Your first prompt is a draft. The AI's first response is a draft. Expect to iterate 1-3 times to get production-ready output.

Good follow-up prompts:
- "Make it shorter."
- "Add a section about the equipment issue."
- "Change the tone to be more direct."
- "Put the staffing numbers in a table."
- "Remove the third bullet point and expand the first one."

> **From Research:** "View your first prompt as a foundation for refinement, not a final product. Initial responses often require adjustment; iteration is normal and expected."
> **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Iterate Rather Than Perfect

---

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Skipping the ROLE component
- Why it happens: People jump straight to what they need without setting the persona
- How to avoid: Always start with "You are..." It takes 5 seconds and dramatically improves output.
- **Source:** research.md, Common Pitfalls - Vague prompts

**Mistake 2:** Asking for too many things at once
- Why it happens: People try to get everything in one prompt to save time
- How to avoid: Break complex requests into steps. Do one thing well, then follow up. "First, analyze the data. Then, create the summary. Then, draft the email."
- **Source:** research.md, Common Pitfalls - Asking too much at once

**Mistake 3:** Using soft language like "Can you help me with..."
- Why it happens: Being polite is natural
- How to avoid: Be direct. "Create..." "Analyze..." "Draft..." "Summarize..." Direct commands produce better results. You can still be polite, but lead with the action verb.
- **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Use Action-Oriented Language

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 15 minutes (0:45 - 1:00)

SAY: "Here is the single most important skill you will learn today.
If you remember one thing from this entire course, make it this
formula: ROLE plus CONTEXT plus TASK plus FORMAT. Four parts. Every
prompt you write should have all four. Let me show you the
difference it makes."

ASK: "Think about the standup prompt I showed you earlier. Can you
spot the four parts? Where was the role? The context? The task? The
format?" [Walk through the example and label each part.]

DEMO: Show the good vs. bad prompt comparison on screen. Type the
bad prompt into Bottle Rocket and show the vague, unhelpful response.
Then type the good prompt and show the dramatically better response.
The visual contrast is powerful.

TRANSITION: "OK, you have the formula. Now it is your turn. We are
going to write your first real prompt together, step by step. Open
Bottle Rocket if you have not already."
```

---

## Section 5: Exercise 1 -- First Guided Prompt

**Duration:** 20 minutes (1:00 - 1:20)
**Activity:** Guided Exercise (instructor-led, step-by-step)
**Objective:** Write and execute a complete ROLE + CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT prompt in Bottle Rocket

---

### Key Concept

This is hands-on practice. You will write your first real prompt using the formula, submit it to Bottle Rocket, and review the output. The instructor walks you through each step.

---

### Why This Matters

Reading about prompts is different from writing them. This exercise bridges the gap. By the end, you will have a working prompt you created yourself and a tangible AI output you can evaluate.

---

### Exercise Instructions

**Scenario:** You are preparing a shift handoff summary. The morning shift is ending and you need to brief the afternoon shift supervisor on what happened during your shift.

**Step 1: Write the ROLE (2 minutes)**

Open Bottle Rocket at go.tesla.com/chat. Select Qwen 3 30B as your model. Type the following:

```
You are an experienced distribution center shift supervisor
writing a handoff summary for the incoming afternoon shift.
```

Do not press Enter yet. We are building the full prompt.

**Step 2: Write the CONTEXT (3 minutes)**

Use real details from your own DC if you are comfortable. Otherwise, use this example. Add it below the role:

```
CONTEXT: Morning shift at the Chicago DC. We had 40 associates
today. We processed 2,650 orders (target was 2,800). Two pick
stations had scanner issues from 9-10 AM that slowed throughput.
One associate reported a near-miss with a pallet jack in Aisle 7.
Maintenance fixed the scanners by 10:15 AM and throughput recovered
for the rest of the shift.
```

**Step 3: Write the TASK (2 minutes)**

Add the specific request:

```
TASK: Write a concise shift handoff summary that the afternoon
supervisor can read in under 2 minutes.
```

**Step 4: Write the FORMAT (2 minutes)**

Specify how you want the output:

```
FORMAT: Use these sections:
1. Shift Overview (3-4 bullet points on key metrics)
2. Issues & Resolutions (what happened and what was done)
3. Open Items for Afternoon Shift (what they need to follow up on)
4. Safety Note (the near-miss incident)

Keep the total under 200 words.
```

**Step 5: Submit and Review (5 minutes)**

- Press Enter to submit your full prompt
- Read the output carefully
- Does it cover all four sections you asked for?
- Is it under 200 words?
- Is anything missing or inaccurate?

**Step 6: Iterate (6 minutes)**

Now improve the output. Try one of these follow-ups:

- "Add the specific scanner model number: Zebra MC9300."
- "Make the safety note section more detailed. Include the aisle number and the time of the incident."
- "Change the tone to be more urgent about the near-miss."
- Or write your own follow-up based on what you think is missing.

Review the updated output. Better? Worse? What changed?

---

### What Good Looks Like

A strong shift handoff summary from this exercise will:
- Cover all four sections you requested
- Use clear bullet points, not long paragraphs
- Include specific numbers (2,650 orders, 40 associates)
- Flag the near-miss as a follow-up item
- Be readable in under 2 minutes

---

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Copying the prompt exactly without adding your own details
- Why it happens: Fear of doing it wrong
- How to avoid: Modify the context with real details from your DC. Use your actual headcount, order volume, and recent issues. The AI works better with real context.
- **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Start with Clear Objectives

**Mistake 2:** Accepting the first output without reading it critically
- Why it happens: The output "looks good" at first glance
- How to avoid: Read every line. Check the numbers. Look for anything the AI made up that was not in your prompt. This skill becomes critical in Section 9.
- **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Verify Before Trusting

---

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 20 minutes (1:00 - 1:20)

SAY: "Your turn. We are going to write your first prompt together.
I will walk you through each step. Open Bottle Rocket right now.
Select Qwen 3 30B. Everyone ready?"

ASK: After Step 2 -- "Did anyone use their own DC's real numbers
instead of the example? Great. That is what we want. Real context
makes better outputs."

DEMO: Build your own prompt live on screen share as they build
theirs. Type each section in real-time so they can follow along.
After submitting, read your output aloud and critique it:
"See how it did X well but missed Y? That is why we iterate."

KEY MOMENTS:
- Give everyone 2 minutes per step. Do not rush.
- Walk around (virtually check in) after Step 5. Ask participants
  to share their outputs.
- For Step 6 (iteration), let them choose their own follow-up.
  This builds agency.
- Celebrate the first successful prompt: "You just used AI for a
  real work task. That took 3 minutes. How long does a handoff
  summary usually take you?"

TRANSITION: "You have written one prompt with my help. Now you
are going to write three on your own. Same formula. Different
scenarios. Let's go."
```

---

## Section 6: Exercise 2 -- Create 3 Operations Prompts

**Duration:** 25 minutes (1:20 - 1:45)
**Activity:** Independent Practice
**Objective:** Independently apply ROLE + CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT to three different DC scenarios

---

### Key Concept

This is independent practice. You will write three prompts on your own, each for a different operations scenario. Use the ROLE + CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT formula every time.

---

### Why This Matters

One guided prompt is learning. Three independent prompts is skill-building. By writing prompts for labor planning, safety reporting, and vendor communication, you practice the formula across the range of tasks you do every day.

> **From Research:** "Adults learn most effectively when training connects to practical, immediate use cases."
> **Source:** research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 3 (Andragogy)

---

### Exercise Instructions

Write and submit ALL THREE prompts in Bottle Rocket. For each one, use a new conversation (click "New Chat"). Save your best prompt -- you will use it again in Section 10.

---

#### Prompt 1: Labor Planning Analysis

**Scenario:** You need to analyze next week's staffing plan. Monday is expected to be a high-volume day (130% of normal). Wednesday has 5 associates on PTO. Friday is a holiday and the DC is running a skeleton crew.

**Your task:** Write a prompt that asks AI to review this staffing situation and recommend adjustments.

**Hints if you get stuck:**
- ROLE: workforce planning analyst at a distribution center
- CONTEXT: your DC's typical daily associate count, the three situations described above
- TASK: analyze staffing gaps and recommend specific adjustments for each day
- FORMAT: table format showing Day, Expected Volume, Scheduled Staff, Gap, and Recommended Action

---

#### Prompt 2: Safety Incident Summary

**Scenario:** A forklift near-miss happened yesterday at 2:30 PM in the loading dock area. An associate was walking through a blind corner when a forklift turned the corner. No contact was made, but both individuals reported the event. The area does not have convex mirrors.

**Your task:** Write a prompt that asks AI to create a safety incident summary for your weekly safety report.

**Hints if you get stuck:**
- ROLE: safety compliance specialist at a distribution center
- CONTEXT: the incident details described above
- TASK: draft a formal safety incident summary including root cause analysis and corrective actions
- FORMAT: structured report with sections for Incident Description, Root Cause, Immediate Actions Taken, Corrective Actions Recommended, and Timeline

---

#### Prompt 3: Vendor Communication

**Scenario:** Your vendor (use a generic name like "ABC Logistics") was supposed to deliver 3 pallets of packing supplies on Monday. It is now Wednesday and you have not received the shipment. You are running low and will be out of supplies by Friday if the shipment does not arrive.

**Your task:** Write a prompt that asks AI to draft a professional but firm email to the vendor requesting an immediate update and expedited delivery.

**Hints if you get stuck:**
- ROLE: professional business communicator
- CONTEXT: the vendor delay details described above, urgency of the situation
- TASK: draft an email that is professional but firm, requesting immediate status update and expedited delivery
- FORMAT: email format with subject line, greeting, body (3 short paragraphs), and closing

---

### Scoring Yourself

After each prompt, ask yourself:

| Check | Yes/No |
|-------|--------|
| Did I include a ROLE? | |
| Did I include specific CONTEXT? | |
| Was my TASK specific with an action verb? | |
| Did I specify a FORMAT? | |
| Is the output actually useful for my work? | |
| Did I iterate at least once to improve it? | |

---

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Writing all three prompts the same way
- Why it happens: People find a structure that works and repeat it
- How to avoid: Each scenario is different. A labor planning analysis needs tables. A safety report needs formal sections. A vendor email needs a professional tone. Vary your FORMAT.
- **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Start with Clear Objectives

**Mistake 2:** Not iterating
- Why it happens: The first output seems "good enough"
- How to avoid: Read the output critically. Is the tone right? Is anything missing? Add one follow-up to each prompt. Even "make it 20% shorter" counts.
- **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Iterate Rather Than Perfect

---

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 25 minutes (1:20 - 1:45)

SAY: "You are on your own now. Three prompts. Three different
scenarios. Use the formula every time: ROLE, CONTEXT, TASK, FORMAT.
I will be here if you get stuck, but try it yourself first. You
have 25 minutes. That is about 8 minutes per prompt."

ASK: At the 12-minute mark -- "How is everyone doing? Has anyone
gotten a really good output they want to share?" [Let 1-2 people
share briefly. This keeps energy up.]

DEMO: No instructor demo during this section. Walk around (or
monitor chat) and provide individual support.

KEY MOMENTS:
- If someone finishes early, challenge them: "Great. Now iterate
  on your best one. Can you make it even better?"
- If someone is stuck, ask: "What is the role? What is the
  context?" Walk them through the formula.
- Remind everyone: "Save your best prompt. You will use it again
  in Section 10."

TRANSITION: "Excellent work. Let's take a well-earned 10-minute
break. When we come back, we will talk about the different AI
models inside Bottle Rocket and when to use each one."
```

---

## BREAK

**Duration:** 10 minutes (1:45 - 1:55)

```
SAY: "Great work in the first half. Take 10 minutes. Stretch,
grab coffee, check your phones. When we come back, we will talk
about the AI models inside Bottle Rocket and when to use each one."
```

---

## Section 7: Understanding AI Models

**Duration:** 20 minutes (1:55 - 2:15)
**Activity:** Lecture + Demo
**Objective:** Understand the AI models available in Bottle Rocket and when to use each one

---

### Key Concept

Bottle Rocket gives you access to multiple AI models. Each model is built by a different company. Each has different strengths. Choosing the right model for your task is like choosing the right tool from a toolbox. You would not use a hammer to turn a screw.

You do not need to understand how these models work technically. You need to know which one is best for which job.

---

### Why This Matters

Using the wrong model wastes time. You might get a mediocre output with one model and an excellent output with another -- same prompt, different model. Knowing which to pick saves you from unnecessary iterations and frustration.

---

### The Models: A Plain-English Guide

---

### When to Use Which Model: Quick Reference

| Task | Recommended Model | Why |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| Morning standup prep | Qwen 3 30B | Fast, reliable, everyday task |
| Vendor email (sensitive) | Grok 4 | Needs nuanced tone |
| KPI analysis report | Gemini 3 Pro or Grok 4 | Data-heavy, needs accuracy |
| Safety incident summary | Qwen 3 235B | Needs careful, precise language |
| Training outline for new associates | Qwen 3 30B | Clear, structured, fast |
| Leadership presentation talking points | Grok 4 | Needs polished, strategic thinking |
| Quick question about a process | Qwen 3 30B | Fast answer needed |
| Detailed root cause analysis | Qwen 3 235B | Deep reasoning required |

**The simple rule:** Start with Qwen 3 30B for most tasks. If you need deeper analysis, switch to Grok 4 or Qwen 3 235B. If you need fast data work, try Gemini 3 Pro.

---

### Technical Concepts Made Simple

You do not need to become a technical expert. But three concepts will help you understand why models behave the way they do.

**1. Context Window (How much the AI can "remember" in one conversation)**

Think of the context window as the AI's short-term memory. It can only "see" a certain amount of text at once. Once the conversation gets too long, it starts forgetting the early parts.

- For most tasks, this is not a problem.
- If you paste a very long document (20+ pages), the AI might miss details near the beginning.
- Solution: for long documents, break them into sections and process each one separately.

**2. Hallucination (When the AI makes things up)**

This is the biggest risk with AI. The AI does not "know" things. It predicts likely-sounding text. Sometimes that prediction is wrong. The AI will present false information with the same confidence as true information.

- Example: You ask the AI for safety regulations and it gives you a regulation number that does not exist. It sounds real. It looks real. It is made up.
- This is why verification is mandatory. We cover this in detail in Section 9.

**3. Temperature (How "creative" vs. "predictable" the AI is)**

Temperature is a setting that controls randomness. Low temperature means more predictable, consistent responses. High temperature means more creative, varied responses.

- For operations work (reports, emails, analysis), lower temperature is usually better -- you want consistency.
- For brainstorming or creative tasks, higher temperature can be helpful.
- In Bottle Rocket, the default temperature is usually fine for your work. You do not need to adjust it.

---

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Using the same model for everything
- Why it happens: People find one model that works and never try others
- How to avoid: Experiment. Try the same prompt on two different models. Compare the results. You will quickly learn your preferences.
- **Source:** research.md, Tool-Specific Insights

**Mistake 2:** Thinking one model is "better" than all others
- Why it happens: Online reviews and social media create brand loyalty
- How to avoid: Each model has strengths. Grok 4 is great at analysis. Qwen 3 235B is great at careful reasoning. Qwen 3 30B is the best all-rounder. Gemini 3 Pro is strong with data. Use the right tool for the job.
- **Source:** research.md, Tool-Specific Insights

**Mistake 3:** Worrying about technical details
- Why it happens: AI has a lot of jargon (tokens, parameters, fine-tuning)
- How to avoid: You do not need to understand how the engine works to drive the car. Focus on writing good prompts and choosing the right model. That is 95% of the value.
- **Source:** research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 3 (Adult Learning)

---

### Personas — Customize How the AI Responds

Bottle Rocket includes **Personas** — pre-built AI personalities that change how the AI responds to your prompts. Think of personas as giving the AI a specific role before you even start typing.

**4 Curated Personas (available in the sidebar):**

| Persona | What It Does | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Feynman** | Explains complex topics in simple, clear terms | Training materials, breaking down technical concepts for your team |
| **General** | Balanced, all-purpose assistant | Everyday tasks, general operations work |
| **Swiss Army Knife** | Multi-tool assistant for diverse tasks | Formatting, analysis, writing, brainstorming — when you need versatility |
| **The Visionary** | Strategic, big-picture thinking | Planning, initiative design, leadership presentations |

**Custom Personas:** You can also create your own persona with custom instructions. For example, a "DC Operations Manager" persona pre-loaded with your site's SOPs and standard processes. This saves you from repeating context in every prompt.

**How to Use:** Open the Personas sidebar, click a persona to activate it, then type your prompt normally. The persona shapes the style and approach of the response without changing the underlying model.

---

### Tesla Employees Are Already Building AI Agents (Nabu Platform)

Beyond the chat interface, Tesla employees are building their own AI agents on the **Nabu** platform (nabu.bottlerocket.tesla.com). These are specialized AI tools that combine custom documents, tailored prompts, and specific settings to solve repeat problems automatically.

**Real Examples from Tesla (38 agents and growing):**

| Agent | Department | What It Does |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **5-Why Analysis Agent** | Operations | Guides structured root cause analysis for production issues |
| **Parts SOP Generator** | Operations | Generates standard operating procedures from parts documentation |
| **Watt Wizard** | Energy | Answers energy storage and battery technical questions |
| **SPARQ** | Engineering | Spark plug analysis and quality inspection checks |
| **Megafactory 5S** | Manufacturing | 5S audit assistance for factory floor operations |

**How a Nabu Agent Works (4 tabs):**
1. **Documents** — Upload markdown files that give the AI domain knowledge
2. **Prompt Management** — Write the system prompt that guides the AI's behavior
3. **Settings** — Configure the agent name, data classification, and access
4. **Playground** — Test the agent before deploying it

**Why This Matters for AGMs:** In Weeks 3-4, you will design your own agent for your DC. Think about what repetitive tasks your team handles daily — that is an agent opportunity. No coding required.

### A Note About GitHub Copilot (Week 3 Preview)

In Week 3, we will introduce GitHub Copilot. It runs inside a code editor called VS Code and uses various AI models for code-related tasks. The key thing to know now: GitHub Copilot is conditionally approved, meaning NO Tesla Data. We will cover it fully in Week 3.

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 15 minutes (2:11 - 2:26)

SAY: "Welcome back from break. Now that you have written a few
prompts, let's talk about the engines behind Bottle Rocket. You
have been using Qwen 3 30B. But there are other models in
there, and each one has different strengths. Think of it like
having four different experts on speed dial. Let me introduce them."

ASK: "When you were writing your prompts in Exercise 2, did anyone
notice the model selector? Did anyone try a different model?"

DEMO:
1. Open Bottle Rocket on screen share
2. Show the model selector dropdown
3. Select Grok 4 and paste a standup prompt -- show the output
4. Switch to Qwen 3 30B and paste the same prompt -- show
   the output
5. Point out the differences: tone, length, detail level, structure
6. Say: "Same prompt. Different model. Different result. Neither
   is wrong -- they just have different strengths."

TRANSITION: "Now that you know the models, let's put them to work.
The next 35 minutes is a deep workshop. Four real DC scenarios.
You will write prompts, get outputs, iterate, and improve. This is
where it gets fun."
```

---

## Section 8: Bottle Rocket Deep Workshop

**Duration:** 35 minutes (2:15 - 2:50)
**Activity:** Workshop (Hands-On)
**Objective:** Apply prompt engineering and model selection to four realistic DC scenarios with full iteration cycles

---

### Key Concept

This workshop is the core hands-on block of the day. You will work through four real scenarios, each representing a common AGM task. For each one, you will write a prompt, get an output, evaluate it, iterate, and improve it. This is the full workflow you will use every day.

---

### Why This Matters

Real skill comes from repetition with realistic scenarios. These four scenarios cover the range of tasks you do as an AGM: data analysis, incident reporting, vendor communication, and team development. By the end, you will have four usable outputs.

---

### Workshop Instructions

Work through all four scenarios. Spend about 8 minutes on each. For each one:

1. **Write** a full ROLE + CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT prompt
2. **Submit** it to Bottle Rocket (choose the model you think is best)
3. **Evaluate** the output -- is it useful? What is missing?
4. **Iterate** with at least one follow-up prompt to improve it
5. **Save** the final version

---

#### Scenario A: Headcount Allocation Analysis

**Situation:** You need to analyze your shift staffing for next week. You have the following data:

| Shift | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Morning (6AM-2PM) | 18 | 16 | 14 | 18 | 12 |
| Afternoon (2PM-10PM) | 15 | 15 | 15 | 13 | 10 |
| Night (10PM-6AM) | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 6 |

Expected order volume: Monday is 120% of normal. Tuesday-Thursday are normal. Friday is 80% of normal (holiday weekend). Normal daily target requires 42 associates across all shifts.

**Your task:** Write a prompt that asks AI to analyze this staffing plan, identify gaps, and recommend adjustments.

**Recommended model:** Gemini 3 Pro or Grok 4 (data analysis)

**After you get your output, iterate:** "Add a column showing cost impact if we bring in overtime associates at 1.5x pay rate for each gap."

---

#### Scenario B: Safety Incident Summary

**Situation:** Yesterday at 3:15 PM, an associate tripped over a floor mat that had curled up at the edge near the break room entrance. The associate fell and scraped their knee. First aid was administered on site. No lost time. The floor mat was replaced immediately. This is the second trip hazard report in this area in 30 days.

**Your task:** Write a prompt that creates a formal safety incident summary including root cause, corrective actions, and a connection to the previous incident in the area.

**Recommended model:** Qwen 3 235B (precise, careful language)

**After you get your output, iterate:** "Add a section called 'Pattern Analysis' that connects this incident to the previous trip hazard report and recommends a broader inspection of all floor mats in the facility."

---

#### Scenario C: Vendor Communication for Delayed Shipment

**Situation:** Your vendor "Pinnacle Packaging" was supposed to deliver 5 pallets of corrugated boxes on Monday morning. It is now Thursday. You have emailed them twice with no response. You have about 2 days of box inventory remaining. If boxes run out, you cannot ship orders.

**Your task:** Write a prompt that drafts a professional but firm email escalating this issue. The email should convey urgency without being aggressive.

**Recommended model:** Grok 4 (nuanced tone)

**After you get your output, iterate:** "Add a sentence mentioning that if we do not receive a delivery confirmation by end of day Friday, we will begin sourcing from an alternate vendor."

---

#### Scenario D: Training Outline for New Associates

**Situation:** You have 8 new associates starting Monday. They will go through a one-week onboarding. You need a training outline that covers safety orientation, equipment basics, pick/pack procedures, and quality standards.

**Your task:** Write a prompt that creates a day-by-day training outline for the first week.

**Recommended model:** Qwen 3 30B (clear structure, fast)

**After you get your output, iterate:** "Add time estimates for each training block and identify which blocks require a trainer present versus self-paced learning."

---

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Spending too long on one scenario
- Why it happens: Perfectionism kicks in
- How to avoid: Set a timer. 8 minutes per scenario. Get a good-enough output and move on. You can come back to polish later.
- **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Iterate Rather Than Perfect

**Mistake 2:** Not trying different models
- Why it happens: Inertia -- sticking with whatever model is selected
- How to avoid: Switch models between scenarios. Use Gemini 3 Pro for the data analysis. Use Qwen 3 235B for the safety report. Compare results.
- **Source:** research.md, Tool-Specific Insights

**Mistake 3:** Forgetting to iterate
- Why it happens: The first output seems complete
- How to avoid: Always add at least one follow-up. The second version is almost always better.
- **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Iterate Rather Than Perfect

---

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 35 minutes (2:15 - 2:50)

SAY: "This is the main event. Four real scenarios from your world.
Headcount analysis, safety reporting, vendor emails, and training
outlines. You are going to write prompts, get outputs, and iterate.
Use different models for different scenarios -- that is part of the
practice. You have about 8 minutes per scenario. Go."

ASK: At the 15-minute mark -- "Quick check: has anyone gotten a
really good output they want to share? Who tried a different
model than they used earlier?"

DEMO: No full demo during this section. Monitor participants and
provide individual coaching. If someone is stuck, help them build
their ROLE and CONTEXT.

KEY MOMENTS:
- At 8 minutes: "Time to move to Scenario B if you have not
  already."
- At 16 minutes: "Scenario C. Vendor email. Try Grok 4 for this
  one -- it handles tone well."
- At 24 minutes: "Last scenario. Training outline. This is a
  great one to save for real use."
- At 33 minutes: "Start wrapping up. Save your best outputs.
  We will need them in 2 sections."

TRANSITION: "Great work. You have now used AI for four real tasks.
But here is the question: how do you know the AI gave you accurate
information? What if it made something up? That is what we cover
next -- quality checking."
```

---

## Section 9: Quality Checking AI Outputs

**Duration:** 20 minutes (2:50 - 3:10)
**Activity:** Lecture + Exercise
**Objective:** Detect hallucinations and verify AI output accuracy

---

### Key Concept

AI makes mistakes. It does not do it on purpose. It does not know it is wrong. It generates text that sounds right based on patterns, but sometimes the pattern leads to false information. This is called a **hallucination** -- when AI presents made-up information as if it were fact.

You are responsible for catching these mistakes before you act on them, share them, or send them to anyone.

> **From Research:** "AI systems exhibit 'overconfidence' -- generating incorrect information with high confidence." AI models "frequently make overconfident predictions about incorrect information" and "may 'hallucinate' false information presented confidently."
> **Source:** research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 1; Best Practices - Verify Before Trusting

---

### Why This Matters

Imagine sending a safety incident summary to regional leadership that cites an OSHA regulation number that does not exist. Or sharing a staffing analysis that uses the wrong overtime rate. Or forwarding a vendor email that references a contract term you never agreed to.

These mistakes damage your credibility. They can also create legal, financial, or safety risks. Quality checking is not optional -- it is part of using AI responsibly.

> **From Research:** "Highly engaged AI users spend approximately 1.5 weeks per year fixing AI mistakes."
> **Source:** research.md, Key Statistics (CyberNews AI Research)

---

### The Three Types of AI Errors

#### Error Type 1: Fabricated Facts

The AI invents specific details that sound real but are not. Examples:
- A regulation number that does not exist
- A statistic with a specific percentage that was never published
- A company policy that the AI made up
- A date or timeline that is wrong

**How to spot it:** If the output includes a very specific fact (a number, a regulation, a date, a name), verify it independently. Ask yourself: "Where would I find this fact to confirm it?"

---

#### Error Type 2: Logical Errors

The AI's reasoning makes a mistake. The individual facts might be right, but the conclusion is wrong. Examples:
- Recommending overtime on a day that is already fully staffed
- Calculating percentages incorrectly
- Drawing a conclusion that contradicts the data you provided

**How to spot it:** Read the output with a critical eye. Does the conclusion actually follow from the data? Do the math yourself for any calculations.

---

#### Error Type 3: Context Mismatch

The AI applies generic knowledge instead of using the specific context you gave it. Examples:
- Recommending a safety procedure that does not apply to your type of facility
- Suggesting a communication style that does not match your company culture
- Using industry averages when you gave it your specific numbers

**How to spot it:** Check whether the output actually uses the information you provided. If you said "42 associates" and the output says "approximately 50 employees," it is using generic knowledge instead of your data.

---

### The Verification Framework: READ-CHECK-CONFIRM

**READ:** Read the entire output carefully. Do not skim.

**CHECK:** For every specific claim, ask:
- Is this fact correct?
- Did I provide this information, or did the AI add it?
- If the AI added it, can I verify it?
- Do the numbers add up?

**CONFIRM:** Before sharing the output, confirm:
- All facts match your knowledge
- All calculations are correct
- The tone and language are appropriate
- Nothing was fabricated

---

### The 80/20 Rule for Verification

Not every AI output needs the same level of verification.

**Verify thoroughly (100% check):**
- Safety reports (lives at stake)
- Communications to leadership (your reputation)
- Anything with numbers or calculations (math errors are common)
- Policy-related content (compliance risk)
- Vendor or customer communications (business relationships)

**Verify normally (spot check):**
- Internal standup talking points
- Training outlines (you will review with your team anyway)
- Brainstorming lists (no one acts on brainstorming without review)
- First drafts you plan to heavily edit

> **From Research:** "Always validate AI outputs, especially for consequential decisions. Cross-reference critical facts, verify calculations with other tools, treat outputs as 'suggestions requiring validation.'"
> **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Verify Before Trusting

---

### Exercise: Find the Errors

**Instructions:** Below is an AI-generated safety incident summary. It contains **3 deliberate errors**. Read it carefully and find all three.

---

**AI-GENERATED OUTPUT (contains 3 errors -- find them):**

> **Safety Incident Summary -- Tampa Distribution Center**
> **Date:** January 28, 2026
> **Shift:** Morning (6:00 AM - 2:00 PM)
>
> **Incident Description:**
> At approximately 10:45 AM, Associate Rodriguez was operating a sit-down counterbalance forklift in Aisle 12 of the warehouse when the forklift's rear wheel struck a wooden pallet that was partially extending into the aisle. The impact caused 3 boxes to fall from the second rack level (approximately 12 feet). One box struck Associate Martinez, who was picking in the adjacent aisle, resulting in a bruise to the left shoulder.
>
> **Classification:** Recordable injury per OSHA Standard 1910.178(q)(12)
>
> **Root Cause Analysis:**
> 1. The pallet was not fully placed on the rack by the previous shift
> 2. Aisle 12 does not have adequate clearance markings
> 3. The forklift pre-shift inspection checklist was completed but did not include a route clearance check
>
> **Immediate Actions Taken:**
> - First aid administered to Associate Martinez (ice pack, injury documented)
> - Pallet secured and aisle cleared
> - Area cordoned off for inspection
> - Incident reported to Shift Supervisor within 15 minutes per OSHA's 15-minute reporting requirement
>
> **Corrective Actions:**
> 1. Add aisle clearance check to all forklift pre-shift inspection checklists (complete by Feb 1)
> 2. Install clearance markings in Aisle 12 and all similar aisles (complete by Feb 7)
> 3. Retrain all forklift operators on aisle awareness procedures (complete by Feb 14)
> 4. Implement weekly pallet placement audits for all shifts

---

### The 3 Errors -- Answers

**Error 1: Fabricated OSHA Standard Number**
The report cites "OSHA Standard 1910.178(q)(12)." This subsection does not exist. OSHA 1910.178 covers powered industrial trucks (forklifts), but the subsection "(q)(12)" is fabricated. The AI invented a regulation number that sounds plausible.

**How to catch it:** Any time AI cites a specific regulation, standard, or policy number, look it up. Do not assume it is real because it has the right format.

**Error 2: Fabricated OSHA Reporting Requirement**
The report mentions "OSHA's 15-minute reporting requirement." OSHA does not have a 15-minute reporting requirement for workplace injuries. OSHA requires employers to report fatalities within 8 hours and inpatient hospitalizations, amputations, or eye losses within 24 hours. The AI made up a specific requirement that sounds reasonable but is false.

**How to catch it:** When AI cites a specific rule or timeframe from an authority, verify it against the actual source.

**Error 3: Logical Error in Classification**
The report classifies this as a "Recordable injury." However, based on the description (a bruise treated with an ice pack and first aid on site), this likely would NOT be recordable under OSHA guidelines. OSHA recordable injuries generally require medical treatment beyond first aid, restricted work duties, or days away from work. A bruise treated with an ice pack is first aid, not a recordable event.

**How to catch it:** Check whether the AI's classification or conclusion matches the facts it described. The facts say "first aid" but the classification says "recordable" -- those two things contradict each other.

---

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Assuming numbers in AI output are correct
- Why it happens: Numbers feel objective and authoritative
- How to avoid: Always double-check math. AI is notoriously bad at arithmetic. If it says "15% increase," verify the calculation yourself.
- **Source:** research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 1 (AI cannot perform reliable arithmetic)

**Mistake 2:** Trusting AI-cited regulations or policy numbers
- Why it happens: Specific citations feel well-researched
- How to avoid: AI makes up citations that look real. Always verify regulation numbers, policy references, and quoted sources against the original.
- **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Verify Before Trusting

**Mistake 3:** Skipping verification because "it looks right"
- Why it happens: AI output reads smoothly and confidently
- How to avoid: Confidence in tone is not the same as accuracy. The most dangerous AI errors are the ones that sound perfectly reasonable.
- **Source:** research.md, Common Pitfalls - Trusting without verifying

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 20 minutes (2:50 - 3:10)

SAY: "Everything you have done today -- the prompts, the outputs,
the exercises -- all of it is only useful if the output is accurate.
And here is the hard truth: AI makes things up. Not on purpose. It
does not know it is wrong. It generates text that sounds right, and
sometimes it is wrong. Your job is to catch the mistakes before
anyone else sees them."

ASK: "Has anyone already noticed something in one of their outputs
today that seemed off? A number that did not add up? A detail that
seemed too specific to be real?"

DEMO: Put the safety incident summary on screen share. Give
participants 5 minutes to read it and find the 3 errors. Then
reveal the answers one by one.

KEY MOMENTS:
- Error 1 (OSHA Standard): This is the most common type of AI
  hallucination. Emphasize: "The format looks right. The number
  sounds real. It is completely made up."
- Error 2 (15-minute requirement): This one is subtle. People
  nod along because it sounds reasonable.
- Error 3 (Recordable classification): This is a logic error.
  The AI contradicted itself. Point out: "The facts say first
  aid. The classification says recordable. Those cannot both
  be true."
- Ask: "If you had sent this to your regional director without
  checking, what would happen?" Let the gravity sink in.

TRANSITION: "Now you know what to look for. In the next exercise,
you are going to take one of your own prompts from earlier, verify
the output, and iterate until it is production-ready."
```

---

## Section 10: Exercise 3 -- Iterate, Verify & Improve

**Duration:** 25 minutes (3:10 - 3:35)
**Activity:** Independent Practice
**Objective:** Apply verification techniques to your own AI outputs, iterate until production-ready, and document the improvement

---

### Key Concept

This exercise combines everything you have learned today: prompt engineering, model selection, and quality checking. You will take a prompt from Exercise 2, apply verification, iterate, and produce output that is genuinely ready to use at work.

---

### Why This Matters

The full workflow is: Write prompt, get output, verify, iterate, verify again, finalize. This exercise practices that complete cycle. By the end, you will have one piece of content that is production-ready -- something you could actually use at your DC tomorrow.

---

### Exercise Instructions

**Step 1: Choose your prompt (2 minutes)**
Go back to your Exercise 2 outputs. Pick your best one -- the labor planning analysis, the safety incident summary, or the vendor email.

**Step 2: Verify the original output (5 minutes)**
Read the output line by line. Apply the READ-CHECK-CONFIRM framework:
- Are all facts accurate?
- Did the AI add anything you did not provide?
- Are all numbers and calculations correct?
- Is the tone appropriate?
- Are there any fabricated citations, regulations, or statistics?

Write down every issue you find.

**Step 3: Iterate to fix issues (8 minutes)**
Use follow-up prompts to fix each issue. Examples:
- "The overtime rate should be 1.5x, not 2x. Please correct."
- "Remove the OSHA citation -- I will add the correct one manually."
- "The tone in paragraph 2 is too aggressive. Make it professional but firm."
- "Add the actual headcount numbers I provided instead of the rounded estimates."

**Step 4: Final verification (5 minutes)**
Read the updated output again. Is everything accurate now? Is the format right? Would you be comfortable sending this to your regional director?

**Step 5: Document your improvement (5 minutes)**
Write a brief note (3-5 sentences) describing:
- What issues you found in the original output
- What you changed through iteration
- How the final version is better than the first version

---

### Before/After Template

Use this to track your improvement:

```
PROMPT USED: [Your original prompt]
MODEL USED: [Which model]

ORIGINAL OUTPUT ISSUES:
1. [Issue found]
2. [Issue found]
3. [Issue found]

ITERATIONS MADE:
1. [Follow-up prompt and what it fixed]
2. [Follow-up prompt and what it fixed]

FINAL OUTPUT QUALITY:
- Accuracy: [1-5]
- Usefulness: [1-5]
- Ready to use at work: [Yes/No]

IMPROVEMENT NOTES:
[3-5 sentences on what you learned]
```

---

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Only fixing surface-level issues (typos, formatting)
- Why it happens: Those are the easiest to spot
- How to avoid: Look deeper. Check facts. Check logic. Check whether the AI used your actual data or substituted its own.
- **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Verify Before Trusting

**Mistake 2:** Accepting "close enough"
- Why it happens: The output is 90% there and the effort to fix the last 10% feels disproportionate
- How to avoid: The last 10% is where credibility lives. A report that is "close enough" with one wrong number damages trust.
- **Source:** research.md, Best Practices - Start with Clear Objectives

---

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 25 minutes (3:10 - 3:35)

SAY: "This is where it all comes together. You are going to take
your best prompt from earlier, apply everything we just learned
about quality checking, and make the output production-ready. By
the end of this exercise, you should have something you could
actually use at your DC tomorrow."

ASK: "Which prompt are you going to work on? Raise your hand if
you are doing the labor planning. Safety report. Vendor email."

DEMO: No instructor demo. Walk around and provide individual
coaching. Focus on people who are struggling with verification.

KEY MOMENTS:
- At 7 minutes: "Has anyone found an error in their output?
  What was it?" [Share examples with the group.]
- At 15 minutes: "You should be on your iteration step now.
  Remember, direct follow-ups work best: 'Fix this specific
  thing.'"
- At 20 minutes: "Start documenting your before/after. What
  changed? What did you learn?"
- At 24 minutes: "One minute left. Who has a production-ready
  output they are proud of?"

TRANSITION: "Excellent. You have now completed the full cycle:
write a prompt, get output, verify it, iterate, and verify again.
That is the workflow you will use every day. Now let's set up the
tracking system so we can measure how much time this saves you."
```

---

## Section 11: Time Savings Baseline Setup

**Duration:** 15 minutes (3:35 - 3:50)
**Activity:** Guided Setup
**Objective:** Establish a personal time-savings tracking baseline and set Week 2 goals

---

### Key Concept

You cannot improve what you do not measure. Starting today, you will track how much time AI saves you on real tasks. This data serves three purposes: it proves the value of AI training, it motivates you to use the tools daily, and it builds the business case for expanding AI training to your 30-50 associates.

---

### Why This Matters

By the end of this course, the target is saving 40-60 minutes per day. That is 3-5 hours per week. Across 5 AGMs, that is 15-25 hours per week of leadership time recovered. For your teams of 30-50 associates, even 15 minutes per person per day adds up to massive productivity gains. But none of that matters if we cannot show the numbers.

---

### Setting Up Your Tracker

**Option 1: Simple Spreadsheet (Recommended)**

Create a spreadsheet (Excel or Google Sheets) with these columns:

| Date | Task | Without AI (est. min) | With AI (actual min) | Time Saved (min) | Model Used | Notes |
|------|------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------|-------|
| 1/31 | Standup prep | 15 | 3 | 12 | Qwen 3 30B | Great output on first try |
| 1/31 | Vendor email | 10 | 4 | 6 | Grok 4 | Needed 2 iterations for tone |
| 1/31 | Safety summary | 20 | 7 | 13 | Qwen 3 235B | Found 1 error, fixed in iteration |

**Option 2: Simple Daily Log**

If a spreadsheet feels like too much, use a simple daily note:

```
Date: January 31
Tasks done with AI: 3
Estimated time saved: 25 minutes
Best result: Standup prep in 3 minutes
Worst result: Safety report needed heavy editing
```

---

### Establishing Your Baseline

**Right now, answer these questions:**

1. **How many minutes per day do you spend on email drafting?** ___
2. **How many minutes per day do you spend on standup/meeting prep?** ___
3. **How many minutes per week do you spend on safety reporting?** ___
4. **How many minutes per week do you spend on vendor communications?** ___
5. **How many minutes per week do you spend on headcount/scheduling analysis?** ___

**Total estimated weekly time on these tasks:** ___ minutes

These are your baseline numbers. We will compare them to your AI-assisted times over the coming weeks.

---

### Your Week 1 Goal

**Target: Save 15-20 minutes per day using Bottle Rocket**

That is achievable right now with what you learned today:
- Standup prep: save 12-15 minutes
- One email draft: save 5-8 minutes
- That is already 17-23 minutes saved

Track every task. Be honest about the time with AI (include review and iteration time). The goal is not to inflate numbers -- it is to see real, sustainable improvement.

---

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Not tracking because "I will remember"
- Why it happens: Tracking feels like extra work
- How to avoid: It takes 30 seconds per task. Keep the spreadsheet open in a browser tab. Log as you go.
- **Source:** research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 3 (Adult Learning -- immediate application)

**Mistake 2:** Inflating time savings
- Why it happens: People want to show good results
- How to avoid: Be accurate. Include iteration time. Include verification time. Honest data is more useful than inflated data.

**Mistake 3:** Only tracking big tasks
- Why it happens: Small tasks seem insignificant
- How to avoid: Track everything. Five 3-minute saves add up to 15 minutes. Small wins compound.

---

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 15 minutes (3:35 - 3:50)

SAY: "We are going to set up one more thing before we wrap up: your
time savings tracker. This is important. Not because I want homework
data -- because this data proves the value of what you are learning.
When your regional director asks 'Is this training worth it?' you
are going to have real numbers."

ASK: "Quick estimate -- how much time do you spend on email drafting
per day? Just ballpark." [Get a few answers. Usually 20-40 minutes.]
"OK. Based on what you saw today, how much of that do you think AI
could handle?" [Let them estimate. Anchor around 50-70% savings.]

DEMO: Screen share a blank spreadsheet with the column headers.
Fill in one row live using a task from today's workshop. Show how
simple it is.

KEY MOMENTS:
- Help anyone who wants to set up their spreadsheet right now
- Have them fill in their baseline answers during this time
- Make sure everyone has a tracking method chosen before moving on

TRANSITION: "Alright. You have Bottle Rocket bookmarked, you know
the formula, you have practiced with real scenarios, you know how
to check AI outputs, and you have your tracker ready. Let's wrap
up and talk about homework."
```

---

## Section 12: Wrap-up & Homework

**Duration:** 10 minutes (3:50 - 4:00)
**Activity:** Lecture
**Objective:** Reinforce key takeaways, assign homework, set expectations for Week 2

---

### Key Concept

Today you went from zero AI experience to writing structured prompts, using Bottle Rocket, selecting models, and checking AI outputs for errors. That is a massive leap in 4 hours. The homework locks in these skills through daily practice.

---

### Today's Key Takeaways

**1. AI is a power tool, not a replacement.**
It handles the repetitive work. You make the decisions. Own every output.

**2. The policy is non-negotiable.**
Approved: Bottle Rocket, IT Assist, Employee Assist, Nova, M365 Copilot Chat (corporate link). Conditional: GitHub Copilot (no Tesla data). Prohibited: everything else. If it is not at go.tesla.com/aitools, do not use it.

**3. ROLE + CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT.**
Four parts. Every prompt. Every time. This is the formula that turns AI from frustrating to useful.

**4. Always verify.**
AI hallucinations are real, confident, and dangerous. You are the quality gate. Check facts. Check math. Check logic.

**5. Iterate.**
The first output is a draft. The second is better. The third is usually production-ready. Iteration is normal, not failure.

**6. Track your time savings.**
Measure everything. 15-20 minutes per day this week. Build from there.

---

### Homework Assignment

**Time Required:** Approximately 45 minutes over the week

**Assignment 1: Complete 3 Real Work Tasks Using Bottle Rocket**
- Choose 3 tasks you actually do this week (emails, reports, summaries, planning)
- Use Bottle Rocket with the ROLE + CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT formula
- Verify each output before using it
- Save the prompts and outputs

**Assignment 2: Track Time Savings Daily**
- Use your tracking spreadsheet or daily log
- Record every AI-assisted task
- Target: 15-20 minutes saved per day
- Be honest -- include review and iteration time

**Assignment 3: Identify Your Best and Worst Prompts**
- At the end of the week, review all your prompts
- Pick your **best prompt** -- the one that gave you the most useful output with the least iteration
- Pick your **worst prompt** -- the one where the output was off, or you had to iterate many times
- Bring both to Week 2. We will analyze what made one work and the other struggle.

**Assignment 4: Continue Daily Bottle Rocket Use**
- Use Bottle Rocket at least once per day for a real work task
- Try different models for different tasks
- The goal is to build a habit, not to be perfect

### What is Coming in Week 2

Next week we level up:
- **Advanced prompting techniques:** Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, and Persona-based prompting
- **Data analysis with AI:** Paste in real DC data and get insights, trends, and executive summaries
- **Structured outputs:** Get AI to produce tables, checklists, and formatted reports consistently
- **Personal prompt library:** Start building a reusable collection of your best prompts
- **Model comparison challenge:** Same prompt, three models -- which is best for what?

Come prepared. Bring your best prompt, your worst prompt, and your time savings data.

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Not doing the homework because "I will just do it next week"
- Why it happens: Busy schedules and competing priorities
- How to avoid: The homework IS your daily work. You are not adding tasks. You are using AI to do tasks you already do. Start tomorrow morning with your standup prep.

**Mistake 2:** Using ChatGPT at home "just to practice"
- Why it happens: ChatGPT is the most well-known tool. People default to it.
- How to avoid: Bottle Rocket is available from home. Use it. Same models, approved platform. Build your habit with the right tool from day one.

### Speaker Notes

```
TIMING: 10 minutes (3:50 - 4:00)

SAY: "Let me tell you what you accomplished today. Four hours ago,
most of you had never used an AI tool. Now you have written
structured prompts, used multiple AI models, found errors in AI
output, and produced work-ready content. That is not nothing.
That is a real skill you can use starting tomorrow morning."

ASK: "What is the one thing from today you are going to use first
thing tomorrow?" [Let each AGM answer. This creates commitment.]

DEMO: No demo. Verbal wrap-up only.

KEY MOMENTS:
- Read the homework aloud. Make sure everyone understands each
  assignment.
- Emphasize: "Bring your best prompt AND your worst prompt to
  Week 2. We learn more from the failures than the successes."
- Remind them of the time savings target: 15-20 minutes per day.
- End on energy: "You are already ahead of 95% of managers who
  try AI without training. That is the stat we started with.
  95% fail. You will not. You have the tools, the formula, and
  the policy knowledge. Go use them."

FINAL: "Thank you all. See you next week. Use Bottle Rocket
every day. Track your time. And enjoy being faster."

## Key Takeaways

1. AI tools augment your work -- they handle the repetitive parts while you make decisions and lead your team. -- *Source: research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 1*
2. Tesla's three-tier policy is non-negotiable: Approved (Bottle Rocket, IT Assist, Employee Assist, Nova, M365 Copilot Chat), Conditional (GitHub Copilot -- no Tesla data), Prohibited (ChatGPT, Claude.ai, all others not at go.tesla.com/aitools). -- *Source: Tesla AI Policy*
3. The ROLE + CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT formula dramatically improves AI output quality. Use it every time. -- *Source: research.md, Key Concepts - Concept 2*
4. AI hallucinations are real, confident, and dangerous. Always verify facts, calculations, and citations before trusting AI output. -- *Source: research.md, Best Practices - Verify Before Trusting*
5. Iteration is normal. Your first prompt is a draft. Refine until the output is production-ready. -- *Source: research.md, Best Practices - Iterate Rather Than Perfect*
6. Track your time savings. Target 15-20 minutes per day this week, building to 40-60 minutes by course end. -- *Source: research.md, Key Statistics (Worklytics 2025)*
