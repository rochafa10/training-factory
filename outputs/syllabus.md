# Course Syllabus: AI Tools for Operations Leaders

**Duration:** 4 weeks
**Session Length:** 120 minutes per week (2 hours)
**Target Audience:** 5 Area General Managers (AGMs) across East Coast Distribution Centers
**Instructor:** Fabricio Rocha, Sr. Regional Manager, Supply Chain Operations
**Primary Tools:** Bottle Rocket (go.tesla.com/chat) & GitHub Copilot in VS Code

---

## Course Overview

This course transforms how Tesla AGMs work by teaching practical AI skills that can be applied immediately. Over four weeks, participants will progress from AI fundamentals to building their own automation tools, with a focus on real distribution center scenarios.

The course emphasizes a 60/40 hands-on to instruction ratio—participants will spend more time doing than listening. Every concept is taught through practical exercises using real (non-confidential) operations scenarios. By the end, each participant will have a personal prompt library and at least one working automation tool.

Success is measured not just by skill acquisition, but by documented time savings. The goal is for each AGM to save 30+ minutes daily through AI-assisted tasks.

---

## Learning Goals

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

1. **Use Bottle Rocket confidently** for daily operations tasks
2. **Write effective prompts** without needing help
3. **Know policy boundaries** - when AI is appropriate vs. not
4. **Save 30+ minutes daily** through AI-assisted tasks (measured)
5. **Build advanced automations** using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode with voice, MCPs, and multi-agent orchestration
6. **Complete a personal AI project** solving a real problem at their DC

### Real-World Exercise: Dive Deep Report Automation

**Scenario:** Your regional director needs a dive deep report on yesterday's missed shipments. Normally this takes 45+ minutes to compile.

**The Agent Workflow:**
1. **Voice Input:** Dictate the dive deep requirements
2. **Data Agent:** Reads CSV export of shipment data (placeholder data provided)
3. **Analysis Agent:** Identifies root causes, patterns, outliers
4. **Report Agent:** Generates formatted dive deep document
5. **Output:** Markdown file ready for SharePoint upload

**Exercise Instructions:**
1. Open VS Code with your MCP-enabled workspace
2. Use voice to describe the dive deep you need
3. Let the agent orchestrate the analysis
4. Review and iterate on the output
5. Export the final report

**Sample Voice Prompt:**
> "I need a dive deep on missed shipments from yesterday. Pull the data from shipments.csv, identify the top 3 root causes, calculate the impact by customer, and generate a report with an executive summary, detailed findings, and action items. Format it for leadership review."

---

### Real-World Exercise: Excel/SharePoint Auto-Update

**Scenario:** You maintain a weekly KPI tracker in Excel. Update it automatically.

**The Workflow:**
1. Agent reads the current Excel template structure
2. Agent generates Python script to update specific cells
3. Agent creates the updated values based on your data
4. You review and approve the changes

**Note:** For Tesla data, use Bottle Rocket for analysis, then use Copilot only for the automation code with placeholder data.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Sequential** | Agent A → Agent B → Agent C | Dive deep (gather → analyze → report) |
| **Parallel** | Agents A, B, C run simultaneously | Multi-DC comparison reports |
| **Supervisor** | Main agent delegates to specialists | Complex incident analysis |
| **Human-in-Loop** | Agent pauses for approval at key steps | Any task with Tesla data decisions |
