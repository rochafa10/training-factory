- **Title:** Interviews Are a Leadership Competency
- **Bullets:**
  - Every promotion, lateral move, and external opportunity starts with an interview
  - Your technical skills got you here — your interview skills get you there
  - Bad interviews cost: the wrong hire costs 30% of their annual salary
  - As leaders, you interview AND get interviewed — both require preparation
  - Today: frameworks you can use tomorrow, whether you're in the hot seat or behind the desk

- **Bullets:**
  - **A — Answer:** Lead with a clear, direct answer to the question asked
  - **C — Cite:** Back it up with a specific, relevant example from your experience
  - **E — Explain:** Connect the example to the impact and the role you're pursuing
  - Works best for: direct questions, competency questions, "Tell me about yourself"

---

## Slide 08
- **Type:** Grid
- **Image:** ../images/ace-breakdown--minimal.png
- **Title:** ACE Breakdown — Each Step in Detail
- **Cards:**
  - A | ANSWER | Direct response. No preamble, no throat-clearing. Get to the point.

  - E | EXPLAIN | Link it back. Why does this matter for THIS role? Show self-awareness.

---

## Slide 09
- **Type:** Comparison
- **Image:** ../images/ace-comparison--minimal.png
- **Title:** ACE in Action — "Are you a strong leader?"
- **Left Column:**
  - **Header:** Weak Response
  - "Yeah, I think I'm a good leader. People like working for me and I try to be fair. I've been a manager for a few years now."
  - No evidence, vague, forgettable
  - Sounds like everyone else
- **Right Column:**
  - **Header:** ACE Response
  - "**A:** Yes — I lead through ownership and follow-through."
  - "**C:** At my last DC, I inherited a team with 34% turnover. I built 1-on-1 cadence, restructured shifts based on associate feedback, and launched a peer recognition program."
  - "**E:** Within 6 months, turnover dropped to 12% and throughput increased 18%. That's the kind of impact I want to bring to this GM role."

---

## Slide 10
- **Type:** Exercise
- **Badge:** Practice 1
- **Title:** ACE Your "Tell Me About Yourself"
- **Time:** 5 minutes

  1. Think of a leadership accomplishment you're proud of
  2. Write a 3-sentence ACE response (Answer → Cite → Explain)
  3. Keep it under 90 seconds when spoken
  4. Share with a partner and get feedback
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Starts with a direct answer (not "Well, so...")
  - Includes a specific example with a number
  - Connects back to the target role

---

## Slide 11
- **Type:** Divider
- **Section:** 3
- **Title:** The STAR Method Deep Dive
- **Duration:** 20 minutes

---

## Slide 12
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/star-framework--minimal.png
- **Title:** STAR — The Gold Standard for Behavioral Questions
- **Bullets:**
  - **S — Situation:** Set the scene briefly. Where were you? What was happening?
  - **T — Task:** What was YOUR specific responsibility in that situation?
  - **A — Action:** What did YOU do? Not the team — YOU. Be specific.
  - **R — Result:** What happened? Quantify the outcome. What did you learn?
  - Use when you hear: "Tell me about a time when..." or "Give me an example of..."
  - Target length: 2-3 minutes per story

---

## Slide 13
- **Type:** Grid
- **Image:** ../images/star-time-split--chart.png
- **Title:** The STAR Time Split
- **Cards:**
  - 10% | SITUATION | 2-3 sentences of context. Don't over-explain.
  - 10% | TASK | 1-2 sentences. What were YOU responsible for?
  - 60% | ACTION | This is the main event. Detail your specific steps.
  - 20% | RESULT | Quantified outcomes + lessons learned.

---

## Slide 14
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/metric-gap--minimal.png
- **Title:** Situation: Frame It as a Metric Gap
- **Bullets:**
  - Always anchor your Situation in a number: "Target was X, we were at Y"
  - The gap IS the story — it creates urgency and makes the interviewer lean in
  - Quantify the duration: how long has the gap persisted?
  - Strong: "Our DC's on-time delivery target was 95%. We'd been running at 78% for 6 weeks."
  - Weak: "We had some issues with delivery."

---

## Slide 15
- **Type:** Grid
- **Title:** Metric Gap Templates
- **Cards:**
  - THROUGHPUT | Target: 1,200 units/shift. Actual: 940. Gap: 22% below target.
  - TURNOVER | Benchmark: 15% annual. Our site: 34%. Gap: 2.3x above target.
  - SAFETY | Goal: 0 recordable incidents. YTD Q1: 4 incidents. Gap: 3x prior year.

---

## Slide 16
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/mechanism-framework--minimal.png
- **Title:** Action: Build a Mechanism, Not Just a Fix
- **Quote:** "Good intentions never work, you need good mechanisms to make anything happen." — Jeff Bezos
- **Bullets:**
  - **Tool** — The structural thing you built: a process, dashboard, checklist, or meeting cadence
  - **Ownership** — A specific person accountable for the mechanism after you leave
  - **Adoption** — Broad implementation, not just you using it — teams, sites, the organization
  - **Inspection** — Regular auditing and course correction: metrics, reviews, continuous improvement
  - The interviewer hears: "This person builds systems, not heroics."

---

## Slide 17
- **Type:** Comparison
- **Title:** Good Intentions vs. Mechanism
- **Left Column:**
  - **Header:** Good Intentions (Heroics)
  - "I personally stayed late to check every order before it shipped."
  - Depends on your presence — collapses when you leave
  - Shows effort, but not systems thinking
- **Right Column:**
  - **Header:** Mechanism (Tool + Own + Adopt + Inspect)
  - Tool: "I built a daily capacity dashboard that flags bottlenecks by hour"
  - Ownership: "I assigned 2 shift leads as dashboard owners with escalation rules"
  - Adoption: "Rolled out across 3 DCs — Greenville, Tampa, and Chicago"
  - Inspection: "Weekly ops review audits the dashboard; leads course-correct same day"

---

## Slide 18
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/pyramid-principle--minimal.png
- **Title:** Action: Peel the Onion (Pyramid Principle)
- **Bullets:**
  - Start with the answer: state WHAT you did in one sentence, then peel layers deeper
  - **Layer 1 — Governing Thought:** The single sentence that captures your entire action
  - **Layer 2 — Key Pillars (MECE):** 2-3 non-overlapping action areas that fully cover what you did
  - **Layer 3 — Evidence:** Specific details under each pillar (data, tools, people, timelines)
  - Anti-pattern: chronological brain dump — "First I... then I... then I..." (interviewer gets lost)

---

## Slide 19
- **Type:** Content
- **Title:** Peeling the Onion — Worked Example
- **Content:**
  - Governing thought: "I redesigned the pack-station workflow and staffing model across 3 sites."
  - Pillar 1 — Diagnosed: "Analyzed 4 weeks of shift data, identified a 2-hour bottleneck window"
  - Pillar 2 — Redesigned: "Restructured staffing to add 3 associates during peak, implemented 15-min shift overlaps"
  - Pillar 3 — Scaled: "Trained 2 shift leads to run the model, partnered with Greenville and Tampa to pilot"
  - Compare with weak chronological: "First I looked at data, then I talked to leads, then I moved people around..."

---

## Slide 20
- **Type:** Comparison
- **Title:** Strong STAR vs. Weak STAR
- **Left Column:**
  - **Header:** Weak STAR
  - S: "We had a problem at the warehouse"
  - T: "I had to fix it"
  - A: "We all worked together and figured it out"
  - R: "It worked out fine"
  - Vague, uses "we" not "I", no metrics
- **Right Column:**
  - **Header:** Strong STAR
  - S: "In Q3, our Greenville DC was running 15% behind on daily ship targets for 3 consecutive weeks"
  - T: "As AGM, I was responsible for diagnosing the root cause and getting us back on track"
  - A: "I analyzed shift data, identified a bottleneck at the pack station, reorganized staffing to add 3 associates during peak hours, and implemented 15-minute shift overlaps"
  - R: "Within 2 weeks, we hit 102% of target. The overlap model was adopted by 2 other DCs"

---

## Slide 21
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/star-mistakes--minimal.png
- **Title:** The 5 Most Common STAR Mistakes
- **Bullets:**
  - **Too long on Situation** — Spending 2 minutes on context, 30 seconds on action
  - **Using "we" instead of "I"** — Interviewers want YOUR contribution, not the team's
  - **No numbers** — "It improved" vs. "It improved throughput by 22%"
  - **Picking the wrong story** — Choose stories relevant to the role, not just impressive ones
  - **No lesson learned** — Great candidates show growth, not just results

---

## Slide 22
- **Type:** Content
- **Title:** Build Your STAR Story Bank
- **Bullets:**
  - Prepare 8-10 stories that cover the most common behavioral themes
  - Each story can be adapted to multiple questions
  - Theme categories: Leadership, Conflict Resolution, Problem Solving, Failure/Learning, Innovation, Teamwork
  - Write each one out. Practice out loud. Time yourself.
  - One great story, well-told, beats five mediocre ones

---

## Slide 23
- **Type:** Grid
- **Image:** ../images/story-bank-themes--minimal.png
- **Title:** Story Bank — Cover These 6 Themes
- **Cards:**
  - 1 | LEADERSHIP | A time you led a team through a challenge or change
  - 2 | CONFLICT | A time you resolved a disagreement or difficult conversation
  - 3 | PROBLEM SOLVING | A time you solved a complex operational problem
  - 4 | FAILURE | A time something went wrong and what you learned from it
  - 5 | INNOVATION | A time you improved a process or introduced something new
  - 6 | PRESSURE | A time you delivered results under a tight deadline

---

## Slide 24
- **Type:** Exercise
- **Badge:** Practice 2
- **Title:** Build Your First STAR Story
- **Time:** 8 minutes
- **Steps:**
  1. Pick ONE theme from the Story Bank (leadership, conflict, problem solving, etc.)
  2. Think of a real work situation that fits
  3. Write out each STAR component — 1-2 sentences each
  4. Make sure Action is 60% of your story
  5. Include at least one specific number in your Result
  6. Practice telling it in under 3 minutes
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Uses "I" not "we" in the Action section
  - Result includes a quantified outcome
  - Total story fits in 2-3 minutes spoken

---

## Slide 25
- **Type:** Divider
- **Section:** 4
- **Title:** Strengths & Weaknesses
- **Duration:** 15 minutes

---

## Slide 26
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/strengths-weaknesses-why--minimal.png
- **Title:** Why They Ask About Strengths & Weaknesses
- **Bullets:**
  - It's NOT a trick question — interviewers want to see self-awareness
  - Strengths: Do you know what makes you effective? Can you articulate it?
  - Weaknesses: Do you have a growth mindset? Are you honest about limitations?
  - The framework matters more than the specific answer
  - Authenticity beats rehearsed perfection every time

---

## Slide 27
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/strengths-framework--minimal.png
- **Title:** The Strengths Framework: Strength → Evidence → Relevance
- **Bullets:**
  - **Step 1 — Name the Strength:** Be specific, not generic ("operational efficiency" not "hard worker")
  - **Step 2 — Provide Evidence:** A concrete example that proves it
  - **Step 3 — Connect to the Role:** Why this strength matters for THIS position
  - Keep it to 60 seconds. Don't list 5 strengths — go deep on one.
  - Pick a strength that directly maps to a key requirement of the role

---

## Slide 28
- **Type:** Comparison
- **Title:** Strength Answers — What Works vs. What Doesn't
- **Left Column:**
  - **Header:** Generic / Weak
  - "I'm a hard worker and a people person"
  - "I'm detail-oriented"
  - "I never give up"
  - No proof, sounds rehearsed, could be anyone
- **Right Column:**
  - **Header:** Framework / Strong
  - "My strength is operational problem-solving. At my Tampa DC, I noticed our pack rate was declining every Thursday. I dug into the data, found it correlated with a specific associate rotation pattern, and restructured the Thursday schedule. Pack rate went up 14%."
  - "That's the kind of analytical approach I'd bring to this GM role — using data to find and fix hidden patterns."
  - Specific, proven, connected to the role

---

## Slide 29
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/weakness-framework--minimal.png
- **Title:** The Weakness Framework: Honest → Actions → Progress
- **Bullets:**
  - **Step 1 — Name a Real Weakness:** Not a disguised strength. Not a cliche.
  - **Step 2 — Show Actions Taken:** What have you actively done to improve?
  - **Step 3 — Demonstrate Progress:** Show measurable improvement, not perfection
  - The best answers show self-awareness AND a growth mindset
  - Pick a weakness that is real but not disqualifying for the role

---

## Slide 30
- **Type:** Comparison
- **Title:** Weakness Answers — What Works vs. What Doesn't
- **Left Column:**
  - **Header:** What NOT to Say
  - "I'm a perfectionist" (disguised strength)
  - "I work too hard" (cliche)
  - "I have no weaknesses" (arrogant)
  - "I'm terrible with people" (disqualifying for a leadership role)
- **Right Column:**
  - **Header:** Strong Weakness Answer
  - "**Honest:** I used to struggle with delegation. I'd take on too much because I wanted to make sure everything was done right."
  - "**Actions:** I started using a priority matrix — anything not in my top 3 responsibilities, I assign with clear expectations and check-in points."
  - "**Progress:** My direct reports now own 70% of daily operations decisions. My last review specifically noted my improved delegation."

---

## Slide 31
- **Type:** Divider
- **Section:** 5
- **Title:** "Why This Position?" & "Why Now?"
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

---

## Slide 32
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/why-framework--minimal.png
- **Title:** The 3-Part "Why" Framework
- **Bullets:**
  - **Company Alignment:** What about this company resonates with your values and goals?
  - **Role Fit:** How does this specific role match your skills and career trajectory?
  - **Timing Logic:** Why is NOW the right moment for this move?
  - Research the company before the interview — generic answers are obvious
  - Connect your personal career story to their specific opportunity

---

## Slide 33
- **Type:** Comparison
- **Title:** "Why This Position?" — Flat vs. Compelling
- **Left Column:**
  - **Header:** Flat Answer
  - "I think it would be a great opportunity. I've always wanted to work at a bigger company and this seemed like a good next step."
  - No research, self-focused, interchangeable
- **Right Column:**
  - **Header:** Compelling Answer
  - "**Company:** Tesla's mission to accelerate sustainable energy aligns with what I care about — I want my work to matter beyond the balance sheet."
  - "**Role:** This GM role manages the exact scale I've been building toward — 40+ associates, multi-shift operations, direct P&L ownership."
  - "**Timing:** I've spent 3 years mastering AGM operations. I've built the systems, developed the team, and now I'm ready to own the full operation."

---

## Slide 34
- **Type:** Content
- **Title:** "Why Now?" — Framing Transitions Positively
- **Bullets:**
  - NEVER badmouth your current employer or role
  - Frame as "moving toward" not "running from"
  - Show progression: "I've accomplished X, and now I'm ready for the next challenge"
  - If layoff/restructuring: "The change gave me the opportunity to be intentional about my next step"
  - Your "why now" should feel like the natural next chapter, not a desperate escape

---

## Slide 35
- **Type:** Divider
- **Section:** 6
- **Title:** Additional Frameworks
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

---

## Slide 36
- **Type:** Grid
- **Image:** ../images/frameworks-comparison--minimal.png
- **Title:** Framework Quick Reference — CAR, PAR, SOAR
- **Cards:**
  - CAR | Challenge → Action → Result | Best for problem-solving questions. "What's the biggest challenge you've faced?"
  - PAR | Problem → Action → Result | Best for "tell me about a time" questions. Simpler than STAR.
  - SOAR | Situation → Obstacle → Action → Result | Best for adversity questions. Emphasizes what stood in your way.

---

## Slide 37
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/framework-decision--minimal.png
- **Title:** When to Use Which Framework
- **Bullets:**
  - **ACE:** Direct questions, competency questions, "Tell me about yourself"
  - **STAR:** Behavioral questions, "Tell me about a time when..."
  - **CAR:** Problem-solving questions, "What's the biggest challenge..."
  - **PAR:** Simple behavioral questions when STAR feels like overkill
  - **SOAR:** Adversity and resilience questions, "Tell me about a setback..."
  - Pro tip: Most stories can be told in any framework — pick the one that fits the question

---

## Slide 38
- **Type:** Divider
- **Section:** 7
- **Title:** The Two-Way Interview
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

---

## Slide 39
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/two-way-interview--minimal.png
- **Title:** You're Evaluating Them Too
- **Bullets:**
  - The best interviews are conversations, not interrogations
  - You should leave knowing if this role is right for YOU
  - Asking smart questions signals confidence and preparation
  - Avoid questions you could Google — ask what only an insider would know
  - Questions to ask: "What does success look like in the first 90 days?" / "What's the biggest challenge the team is facing right now?" / "How is performance measured and rewarded?"

---

## Slide 40
- **Type:** Content
- **Image:** ../images/red-green-flags--minimal.png
- **Title:** Red Flags & Green Flags in an Employer
- **Bullets:**
  - **Green flags:** Clear expectations, growth path, team stability, honest about challenges
  - **Red flags:** Vague answers about role, high turnover they can't explain, rushing the process
  - **Ask yourself:** Would I want to work for THIS interviewer?
  - A good company will respect your questions — a red flag company will be annoyed by them
  - Trust your gut: if something feels off in the interview, it's usually worse on the inside

---

## Slide 41
- **Type:** Divider
- **Section:** 8
- **Title:** Putting It All Together
- **Duration:** 5 minutes

---

## Slide 42

  - Prepare your ACE for "Tell me about yourself" — practice until it's natural
  - Know your strength (with evidence) and weakness (with actions + progress)
  - Write your "Why this company?" and "Why now?" answers
  - Prepare 3-5 thoughtful questions to ask THEM

---

## Slide 43
- **Type:** Summary
- **Image:** ../images/key-takeaways--minimal.png
- **Title:** Key Takeaways
- **Takeaways:**
  1. ACE every direct question — Answer first, Cite evidence, Explain the connection
  2. STAR is your go-to for behavioral questions — spend 60% of your time on the Action
  3. Strengths & Weaknesses are about self-awareness — use the frameworks, be authentic
  4. It's a two-way street — evaluate the opportunity as much as they evaluate you
  5. Preparation is the difference — the 48-hour checklist is your competitive advantage
