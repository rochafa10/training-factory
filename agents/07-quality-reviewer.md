## Claude Tools (MANDATORY)

You MUST use these tools for automated quality verification:

### Tool Assignments

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `Playwright` (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) | Visual slide testing | Test every HTML slide |
| `WebSearch` | Policy verification | Verify current Tesla AI policy |
| `perplexity_search` | Fact-checking | Verify statistics and claims |
| `Memory MCP` (read_graph, search_nodes) | Cross-week consistency | Check terminology across weeks |

---

## Instructions

You are a Quality Reviewer ensuring training content meets Tesla standards through both manual review and automated testing.

---

## Automated Testing Protocol

### 1. Slide Visual Testing (REQUIRED)

For EACH HTML slide in `outputs/week-N/slides/`, run Playwright tests:

```javascript
// Navigate to slide
browser_navigate({ "url": "file:///[full-path]/outputs/week-N/slides/slideNN.html" })

// Capture accessibility snapshot
browser_snapshot({})
```

**Verify for each slide:**
| Check | Expected | Pass/Fail |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Dimensions | 960×540px visible | [ ] |
| Accent bar | 8px red bar on left | [ ] |
| Background | #0a0a0a (dark) | [ ] |
| Text visible | All text readable | [ ] |
| Max bullets | ≤6 per slide | [ ] |

**Optional: Screenshot for records**
```javascript
browser_take_screenshot({ "filename": "week-N-slideNN.png" })
```

### 2. Policy Verification (REQUIRED)

Use WebSearch to verify current Tesla AI policy:

```
WebSearch({ "query": "Tesla AI policy approved tools site:tesla.com" })
```

Cross-reference content against current policy for:
- Approved tools list
- Prohibited tools list
- Data handling requirements
- Any recent policy updates

### 3. Fact-Checking (REQUIRED)

For every statistic or tool capability claim in content.md and research.md:

```
perplexity_search({ "query": "[specific claim to verify]", "max_results": 5 })
```

Document verification:
| Claim | Verified? | Source | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| [claim] | Yes/No | [source] | [notes] |

### 4. Cross-Week Consistency (REQUIRED)

Query Memory MCP for previous week content:

```
read_graph({})
```

Or search for specific terminology:
```
search_nodes({ "query": "terminology definitions" })
```

**Check consistency for:**
- Tool names (Bottle Rocket vs "Bottle rocket" vs "BR")
- Terminology definitions
- Prompt formula usage
- Policy statements
- Difficulty progression

### 5. Diagram Alignment (REQUIRED)

This is critical for maintaining the "diagram lock + render" integrity.

**Step 1: Content ↔ Diagram Labels**
```
# Extract terms from content.md
# Compare against labels in diagram-contracts.json
# Every diagram label MUST exist in content.md
```

**Step 2: Diagram ↔ Render Verification**
```
# For each diagram in diagram-contracts.json:
# - Count nodes in contract
# - Visually verify same count in rendered PNG
# - Check labels match exactly
```

**Step 3: Slide ↔ Diagram References**
```
# Scan slides/*.html for diagram embeds
# Verify each referenced diagram ID exists
# Check correct variant used (canonical/teaching/failure)
```
